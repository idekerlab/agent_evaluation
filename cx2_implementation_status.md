# CX2 String-Based Format Implementation Status

## Context & Requirements

We're implementing a clean, non-backwards-compatible approach to CX2 file handling in the Deckhard system. Key points:

1. **cx2_network.cx2** is the gold standard reference file format
2. We're using string-based formats for both `scoring_criteria` and `display_order`
3. **No legacy compatibility** - this is a fresh, clean implementation
4. The implementation must support the exact format used in cx2_network.cx2

## Progress So Far

1. ✅ Created documentation in **cx2_scoring_and_ordering.md** 
2. ✅ Modified **app/static/js/ndex-import/ndex-import-ui.js** to parse string-based scoring criteria
3. ✅ Modified **app/static/js/ndex-import/deckhard-client.js** to handle string storage of these attributes
4. ✅ **FIXED**: Issues where `scoring_criteria` and `display_order` were not being properly stored/displayed in the Deckhard database

## Implemented Fixes

1. Updated `parseCxToStructuredData` in ndex-import-ui.js to copy all network attributes directly from the first object in the networkAttributes array
2. Updated `findAndParseScoringCriteria` to look for scoring_criteria directly in the network data object
3. Fixed `importNetworkToDeckhard` in deckhard-client.js to access scoring_criteria and display_order directly from the networkData object
4. Fixed validation function call from validateScoringCriteria to validateScoringCriteriaString

## Important Notes

- **NO BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY**: We are making a clean break from previous formats
- All code now treats `scoring_criteria` and `display_order` as plain strings until UI rendering time
- Parsing only happens in the UI layer when rendering forms or displays
- cx2_network.cx2 contains the definitive example of the format

## Testing Approach

1. Import cx2_network.cx2 through the UI
2. Confirm `scoring_criteria` and `display_order` are present in the created object_list
3. Open the reviewer UI and verify scoring criteria are properly rendered
4. Verify the property ordering works correctly in the object display

This implementation focuses on simplicity and directness, with no support for legacy formats.

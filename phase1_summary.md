# Phase 1 Summary: Documentation & Analysis

## Completed Work

I've created several documentation files to capture the current state of the Deckard system:

1. **[System Documentation](./system_documentation.md)** - Comprehensive overview of the system architecture, components, and workflows
2. **[Legacy Code Analysis](./legacy_code_analysis.md)** - Analysis of legacy components and their dependencies on active code
3. **[Flexible Object Model](./flexible_object_model.md)** - Documentation of the flexible object model that has replaced rigid schemas
4. **[API Documentation](./api_documentation.md)** - Documentation of active API endpoints used by the frontend
5. **[Review Objects Analysis](./review_objects_analysis.md)** - Analysis of the discrepancy between different review object models
6. **[Updated README](./updated_README.md)** - Updated project overview with accurate descriptions

## Key Findings

### Active Components

1. **Core System**
   - SQLite database with flexible schema (single 'nodes' table)
   - Object browser interface (app/static/browser.html)
   - Reviewer interface (app/static/reviewer.html)
   - NDEx import interface (app/static/js/ndex-import/ndex-import.html)
   - FastAPI backend with flexible object handling

2. **Special Object Types**
   - `object_list` - Collections of objects to be reviewed
   - `review_list`/`review` - Score and feedback for objects in a list

3. **MCP Server**
   - Provides programmatic access to Deckard for AI systems

### Legacy Components

1. **Rigid Schema Models**
   - Defined in app/view_edit_specs.py
   - Class definitions in models/ directory

2. **Agent Execution Framework**
   - app/routes/agent_routes.py
   - app/task_management.py
   - models/agent.py

3. **Analysis & Review Frameworks**
   - services/analysisrunner.py
   - services/reviewrunner.py
   - Related model classes

4. **Old React Frontend**
   - react-app/ directory
   - Superseded by static HTML/JS interfaces

### Dependency Risks

1. **Highest Risk**:
   - Object routes with mixed legacy/active functionality
   - Review objects with conflicting models

2. **Medium Risk**:
   - MCP server assumptions about object types
   - Frontend JavaScript that might depend on specific object structures

3. **Low Risk**:
   - Knowledge graph routes (generic SQL queries)
   - Database structure (already flexible)

## Special Issue: Review Object Models

An important clarification was made regarding review object models:

1. `review_list` is the canonical object type used by the active frontend
2. The general concept "review" is sometimes used in documentation, but the actual API endpoints and data structures use `review_list`
3. The legacy `review` object type defined in view_edit_specs.py is unused and can be removed

This naming convention exists because reviews in Deckard always operate on collections of objects (object_lists), and creating individual review objects for each item would unnecessarily clutter the database.

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Port Change (8000 â†’ 3000)

1. Update `main.py` to change port from 8000 to 3000
2. Update any hardcoded URLs in frontend code
3. Update MCP server code to point to port 3000
4. Update documentation references to the port

### Phase 3: Incremental Removal with Testing

1. **Agent Routes Removal**
   - Remove app/routes/agent_routes.py
   - Update imports in app/routes/__init__.py
   - Update route registration in app/app.py

2. **Analysis/Review Code Removal**
   - Remove execution endpoints from object_routes.py
   - Remove services/analysisrunner.py and services/reviewrunner.py
   - Remove related model imports

3. **Simplify Object Routes**
   - Remove/simplify rigid schema handling
   - Maintain endpoints used by active interfaces

4. **Clean up Models Directory**
   - Remove unused model classes
   - Start with those that have minimal dependencies

### Phase 4: Final Cleanup and Documentation

1. Update all documentation based on actual code changes
2. Remove unused dependencies from requirements.txt
3. Final testing of core functionality

## Recommendation

Before proceeding with Phase 2 and 3, we should:

1. Decide on a standardized review object model
2. Consider how to handle existing data in the database
3. Create a testing plan to ensure functionality is preserved

These steps will ensure that the cleanup process doesn't break existing functionality while still allowing the system to evolve and improve.

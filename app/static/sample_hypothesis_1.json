  "name": "Increased PKA Activity Leads to Enhanced Neuronal Signaling",
  "hypothesis_text": "We hypothesize that increased protein kinase A (PKA) activity in neurons leads to enhanced synaptic transmission through phosphorylation of AMPA receptors, resulting in improved memory formation and learning capabilities.",
  "biological_context": "Protein kinase A is a crucial enzyme in neuronal signaling pathways. It is activated by cAMP and phosphorylates various substrates that contribute to synaptic plasticity and memory formation.",

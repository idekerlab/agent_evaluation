  "name": "Gut Microbiome Influence on Immune Response",
  "hypothesis_text": "We hypothesize that alterations in gut microbiome composition, specifically decreased Bacteroidetes and increased Firmicutes, lead to chronic low-grade inflammation through increased intestinal permeability and altered immune cell programming, contributing to autoimmune disease development.",
  "biological_context": "The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in immune system development and function. Changes in microbial composition can affect intestinal barrier function and immune cell differentiation, potentially influencing susceptibility to autoimmune disorders.",

"""
Starting from an experimental dataset and a list of proteins of intertest, our analysts have generated 2 hypotheses anlyst's 
that might explain the observed data upon infection of a human cell line with the Dengue virus.

Your task is to carefully review the 2 hypotheses provided, and choose the best one based on the following evaluation criteria:

1) Mechanistic - The hypothesis includes one or more molecular mechanisms involving one or more proteins of interest.
2) Plausible - The hypothesis is plausible is grounded in known molecular functions and interactions.
3) Novel - The hypothesis proposes mechanisms either not known or not known to be relevant to the experimental context.
4) Actionable - The hypothesis actionable can be validated with relatively simple, low-cost experimental techniques".

You must execute your evaluation using only the information provided in the 2 hypotheses.

When presenting your output, only include the following info:
1) Which analyst's hypothesis you deem to be the best one ({analyst_a} or {analyst_b}).
2) What are the reasons that dictated your decision.
3) If the 2 hypotheses are of equivalent quality, don't make a choice and provide a brief explanation supporting your decision.

Here are the hypotheses:
{analyst_a}: {hypothesis_a}
{analyst_b}: {hypothesis_b}

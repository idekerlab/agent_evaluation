"""

Your task is to use the provided data to generate a hypothesis describing mechanisms that may contribute to the disease state and could potentially be targeted by drug therapies. Each hypothesis should meet the following criteria:

1. Incorporate Data Columns: use the specific columns "Protein abundance 24 hours after infection vs mock control", "Protein abundance 48 hours after infection vs mock control", "mRNA expression 24 hours after infection (log2FC_24hpi)", "mRNA expression 48 hours after infection (log2FC_48hpi)", and "siRNA Screen Average Z-score".

2. Verify Data Points: ensure that each data point (protein abundance, mRNA expression, siRNA Z-score) used in the hypothesis is directly extracted and cross-checked from the dataset.

3. Include Molecular Mechanisms: each hypothesis should include one or more molecular mechanisms involving genes/proteins present in the dataset.

4. Plausibility and Novelty: hypothesis must be plausible, grounded in known molecular functions and interactions, and propose mechanisms either not known or not known to be relevant to the experimental context.

5. Actionability: hypothesis should be actionable and can be validated with relatively low-cost experimental techniques.

6. Context focused: if a biological context is provided (such as a specific biological process or a list of genes/proteins of interest), use this information to focus your hypothesis.

Here is the biological context: {biological_context}

When presenting your results, adhere to the following guidelines:

Avoid including any code.
Do not describe the analytical steps you took.
Your output should consist solely of the hypothesis you propose. Each hypothesis should:
- Mention the relevant genes in the dataset with accurate measurement values.
- Provide details about other prior knowledge that supports the hypothesis.
- Follow the 6 criteria described above.

The provided dataset includes measurements of “protein abundance” and “mRNA expression” changes after infection of human cells with Dengue virus as compared to mock infected controls. 

The data has 2 time points: 24 hours after infection or 48 hours after infection.

Here is a detailed description of the columns in the dataset:

A- Official human gene symbol (HGNC)
D- Protein abundance 24 hours after infection
E- Protein abundance 48 hours after infection
G- mRNA expression 24 after infection
H- mRNA expression 48 hurs after infection

Please note:

“Protein abundance” and “mRNA expression” measurements <0 reflect a "decrease" while measurements >0 indicate an "increase".

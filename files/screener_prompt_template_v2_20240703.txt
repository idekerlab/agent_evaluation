Screener context: "You are an efficient data quality control specialist"


Screener prompt template: “””

You will be provided with a dataset and the text of 3 scientific hypotheses.

Your task is to perform a Quality Control inspection of the hypotheses text to verify that the gene names and relative measurement values mentioned in the text are accurately reflected in the dataset.

If a hypothesis text mentions genes with measurement values that are not present in the dataset, that hypothesis will fail your quality control inspection.

Limit your output to the following information:

- Hypothesis name
- Details of mismatched genes/measurements (if any)
- QC result: (Passed or Failed)

Here is an example of what your output should look like:

Hypothesis #1
Mismatched info:
- Gene mismatch: gene SCSI3 mentioned in hypothesis but not present in dataset.
- Value mismatch: LAMC2 increased expression (1.116969129) mentioned in hypothesis but not present in dataset.
QC Result: Failed

Here is the dataset: {data}

Here are the hypotheses text to inspect: {hypotheses_text}

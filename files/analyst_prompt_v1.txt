The provided proteomics "dataset" includes interacting proteins and the measurements of their differential abundance as a ratio between treated and non-treated samples, where the treatment is the infection of human cells with Dengue virus. 
Not all proteins in the dataset have differential abundance measurements.

The dataset has 2 columns with the following headers: name, DV3_24h-Mock_24h. 
The first column contains the protein names and the last columns contains the abundance measurements.
Please note that abundance measurements <0 reflect a "decreased abundance" while measurements >0 indicate an "increased abundance".

Your task is to leverage this dataset to analyze a subset of interacting proteins that are defined as â€œproteins of interest".

First, determine what proteins of interest show a differential abundance recorded in the dataset. 
Then, based on this information and on the known functions of all other proteins of interest, 
I want you to generate a hypothesis describing the mechanisms that may contribute to the disease state 
and could potentially be targeted by drug therapies.

Your hypothesis should meet the following criteria:
1) Include one or more molecular mechanism involving one or more proteins of interest
2) Be plausible - grounded in known molecular functions and interactions
3) Be novel - proposing mechanisms either not known or not known to be relevant to the experimental context
4) Be actionable - can be validated with relatively low-cost experimental techniques

When presenting your results, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- Avoid including any code.
- Do not describe the analytical steps you took.
- Do not merely list the proteins of interest, regardless whether they show a differential abundance recorded in the dataset or not.
- Build your hypotheses taking into consideration the interplay among all proteins of interest, not only those that show a differential abundance in the dataset.

- Your output should consist solely of the identified proteins of interest with changed abundance levels, and the hypothesis you propose.

Here is the set of proteins of interest:

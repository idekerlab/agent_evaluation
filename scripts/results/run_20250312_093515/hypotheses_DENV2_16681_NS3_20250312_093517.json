The presence of both HSPH1 and CDC37 (another heat shock protein co-chaperone) in the top propagation results indicates NS3 may exploit the host heat shock response. HSF1, the master regulator of heat shock response, also appears in the network with a positive Average_Zscore (1.1346), further supporting this hypothesis.",

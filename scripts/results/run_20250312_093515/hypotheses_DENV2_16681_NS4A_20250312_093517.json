VTI1B has the highest propagation weight (0.0800) among human proteins, indicating a potentially direct interaction with NS4A. These SNARE proteins are critical for vesicular trafficking between ER and Golgi, and their disruption could facilitate the membrane rearrangements required for DENV replication complex formation.",

While PARP9/14's role as transcriptional regulators is known, their specific interaction with IFIT proteins is novel. The hypothesis suggests that IFIT proteins, beyond their direct antiviral functions, serve as scaffolds to recruit PARP9/14, which then enhance STAT1/2 activity. This creates a positive feedback loop explaining the sustained upregulation of interferon response genes observed at both 24h and 48h. The mechanism is plausible given the known protein-protein interaction domains in these molecules."

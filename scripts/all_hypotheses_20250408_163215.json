ACTR5 is a critical component of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, which includes other detected interactors NFRKB, ING3, and TFPT. The clustering of multiple INO80 complex components in the interaction network suggests NS2A may target this complex to modulate host chromatin structure and gene expression.",

MRPS16 shows a negative RNAseq_48h value (-2.1632) despite high Average_Zscore (1.7345), suggesting viral capsid may suppress its expression during infection. Other mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPL21, MRPL10) show high Average_Zscores but are closely connected to Capsid, suggesting potential functional interactions that may impair mitochondrial translation.",

GADD45GIP1 is known to regulate cell cycle arrest and stress response pathways. The close network connection suggests Capsid may hijack GADD45GIP1 function to modulate cellular stress responses, potentially creating a more favorable environment for viral replication.",

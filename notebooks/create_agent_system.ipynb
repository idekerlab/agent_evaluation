      "Abstract:  Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare and severe condition that follows benign COVID-19. We report autosomal recessive deficiencies of <i>OAS1</i>, <i>OAS2</i>, or <i>RNASEL</i> in five unrelated children with MIS-C. The cytosolic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-sensing OAS1 and OAS2 generate 2'-5'-linked oligoadenylates (2-5A) that activate the single-stranded RNA-degrading ribonuclease L (RNase L). Monocytic cell lines and primary myeloid cells with OAS1, OAS2, or RNase L deficiencies produce excessive amounts of inflammatory cytokines upon dsRNA or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) stimulation. Exogenous 2-5A suppresses cytokine production in OAS1-deficient but not RNase L-deficient cells. Cytokine production in RNase L-deficient cells is impaired by MDA5 or RIG-I deficiency and abolished by mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) deficiency. Recessive OAS-RNase L deficiencies in these patients unleash the production of SARS-CoV-2-triggered, MAVS-mediated inflammatory cytokines by mononuclear phagocytes, thereby underlying MIS-C.\n",

      "Abstract:  Cytosolic DNA arising from intracellular bacterial or viral infections is a powerful pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) that leads to innate immune host defence by the production of type I interferon and inflammatory cytokines. Recognition of cytosolic DNA by the recently discovered cyclic-GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) induces the production of cGAMP to activate the stimulator of interferon genes (STING). Here we report the crystal structure of cGAS alone and in complex with DNA, ATP and GTP along with functional studies. Our results explain the broad DNA sensing specificity of cGAS, show how cGAS catalyses dinucleotide formation and indicate activation by a DNA-induced structural switch. cGAS possesses a remarkable structural similarity to the antiviral cytosolic double-stranded RNA sensor 2'-5'oligoadenylate synthase (OAS1), but contains a unique zinc thumb that recognizes B-form double-stranded DNA. Our results mechanistically unify dsRNA and dsDNA innate immune sensing by OAS1 and cGAS nucleotidyl transferases.\n",

      "Title:  A diverse range of gene products are effectors of the type I interferon antiviral response.\n",
      "Abstract:  The type I interferon response protects cells against invading viral pathogens. The cellular factors that mediate this defence are the products of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Although hundreds of ISGs have been identified since their discovery more than 25 years ago, only a few have been characterized with respect to antiviral activity. For most ISG products, little is known about their antiviral potential, their target specificity and their mechanisms of action. Using an overexpression screening approach, here we show that different viruses are targeted by unique sets of ISGs. We find that each viral species is susceptible to multiple antiviral genes, which together encompass a range of inhibitory activities. To conduct the screen, more than 380 human ISGs were tested for their ability to inhibit the replication of several important human and animal viruses, including hepatitis C virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, chikungunya virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and human immunodeficiency virus type-1. Broadly acting effectors included IRF1, C6orf150 (also known as MB21D1), HPSE, RIG-I (also known as DDX58), MDA5 (also known as IFIH1) and IFITM3, whereas more targeted antiviral specificity was observed with DDX60, IFI44L, IFI6, IFITM2, MAP3K14, MOV10, NAMPT (also known as PBEF1), OASL, RTP4, TREX1 and UNC84B (also known as SUN2). Combined expression of pairs of ISGs showed additive antiviral effects similar to those of moderate type I interferon doses. Mechanistic studies uncovered a common theme of translational inhibition for numerous effectors. Several ISGs, including ADAR, FAM46C, LY6E and MCOLN2, enhanced the replication of certain viruses, highlighting another layer of complexity in the highly pleiotropic type I interferon system.\n",

      "Abstract:  The innate immune system senses nucleic acids by germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors. RNA is sensed by Toll-like receptor members TLR3, TLR7 and TLR8, or by the RNA helicases RIG-I (also known as DDX58) and MDA-5 (IFIH1). Little is known about sensors for cytoplasmic DNA that trigger antiviral and/or inflammatory responses. The best characterized of these responses involves activation of the TANK-binding kinase (TBK1)-interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) signalling axis to trigger transcriptional induction of type I interferon genes. A second, less well-defined pathway leads to the activation of an 'inflammasome' that, via caspase-1, controls the catalytic cleavage of the pro-forms of the cytokines IL1beta and IL18 (refs 6, 7). Using mouse and human cells, here we identify the PYHIN (pyrin and HIN domain-containing protein) family member absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) as a receptor for cytosolic DNA, which regulates caspase-1. The HIN200 domain of AIM2 binds to DNA, whereas the pyrin domain (but not that of the other PYHIN family members) associates with the adaptor molecule ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain) to activate both NF-kappaB and caspase-1. Knockdown of Aim2 abrogates caspase-1 activation in response to cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA and the double-stranded DNA vaccinia virus. Collectively, these observations identify AIM2 as a new receptor for cytoplasmic DNA, which forms an inflammasome with the ligand and ASC to activate caspase-1.\n",

      "Abstract:  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in various biological roles, including viral infection and antiviral immune responses. To identify influenza A virus (IAV) infection-related circRNAs, we compared the circRNA profiles of A549 cells upon IAV infection. We found that circVAMP3 is substantially upregulated after IAV infection or interferon (IFN) stimulation. Furthermore, IAV and IFN-β induced the expression of QKI-5, which promoted the biogenesis of circVAMP3. Overexpression of circVAMP3 inhibited IAV replication, while circVAMP3 knockdown promoted viral replication, suggesting that circVAMP3 restricts IAV replication. We verified the effect of circVAMP3 on viral infection in mice and found that circVAMP3 restricted IAV replication and pathogenesis in vivo. We also found that circVAMP3 functions as a decoy to the viral proteins nucleoprotein (NP) and nonstructural protein 1 (NS1). Mechanistically, circVAMP3 interfered with viral ribonucleoprotein complex activity by reducing the interaction of NP with polymerase basic 1, polymerase basic 2, or vRNA and restored the activation of IFN-β by alleviating the inhibitory effect of NS1 to RIG-I or TRIM25. Our study provides new insights into the roles of circRNAs, both in directly inhibiting virus replication and in restoring innate immunity against IAV infection.\n",

      "Abstract:  The excessive activation of immune responses will trigger autoimmune diseases or inflammatory injury. The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) system can capture and mediate ubiquitinated protein degradation, which timely terminates signaling pathway hyperactivation. However, whether the ESCRT system participates in regulating RIGI-like receptor (RLR)-mediated antiviral responses remains unknown. In this study, we show that LTN1/listerin, a major component of RQC, can recruit E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM27 to trigger K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIGI and IFIH1/MDA5. This K63-linked polyubiquitination facilitates the sorting and degradation of RIGI and IFIH1 proteins through the ESCRT-dependent pathway. Concordantly, LTN1 deficiency enhances the innate antiviral response to infection with RNA viruses. Thus, our work uncovers a new mechanism for RIGI and IFIH1 degradation and identifies the role of LTN1 in negatively regulating RLR-mediated antiviral innate immunity, which may provide new targets for the intervention of viral infection.<b>Abbreviation</b>: 5'-pppRNA: 5' triphosphate double stranded RNA; ATG5: autophagy related 5; ATG7: autophagy related 7; BafA1: bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; ESCRT: endosomal sorting complexes required for transport; CHX: cycloheximide; IFIH1/MDA5: interferon induced with helicase C domain 1; IFN: interferon; PIK3C3/VPS34: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3; RIGI: RNA sensor RIG-I; RLR: RIGI-like receptors; RQC: ribosome-associated protein quality control; SeV: Sendai virus; TRIM27: tripartite motif-containing 27; VSV: vesicular stomatitis virus; VPS4: vacuolar protein sorting 4.\n",

      "Abstract:  The retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) receptor senses cytoplasmic viral RNA and activates type I interferons (IFN-I) and downstream antiviral immune responses. How RIG-I binds to viral RNA and how its activation is regulated remains unclear. Here, using IFI16 knockout cells and p204-deficient mice, we demonstrate that the DNA sensor IFI16 enhances IFN-I production to inhibit influenza A virus (IAV) replication. IFI16 positively upregulates RIG-I transcription through direct binding to and recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the RIG-I promoter. IFI16 also binds to influenza viral RNA via its HINa domain and to RIG-I protein with its PYRIN domain, thus promoting IAV-induced K63-linked polyubiquitination and RIG-I activation. Our work demonstrates that IFI16 is a positive regulator of RIG-I signalling during influenza virus infection, highlighting its role in the RIG-I-like-receptor-mediated innate immune response to IAV and other RNA viruses, and suggesting its possible exploitation to modulate the antiviral response.\n",

      "Abstract:  The interferon-inducible protein with tetrapeptide repeats 3 (IFIT3) is one of the most important members in both the IFIT family and interferon-stimulated genes family. IFIT3 has typical features of the IFIT family in terms of gene and protein structures, and is able to be activated through the classical PRRs-IFN-JAK/STAT pathway. A variety of viruses can induce the expression of IFIT3, which in turn inhibits the replication of viruses, with the underlying mechanism showing its crucial role in antiviral innate immunity. Emerging studies have also identified that IFIT3 is involved in cellular biology changes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and cancer development. In this review, we summarize the characteristics of IFIT3 with respect to molecular structure and regulatory pathways, highlighting the role of IFIT3 in antiviral innate immunity, as well as its diverse biological roles. We also discuss the potential of IFIT3 as a biomarker in disease diagnosis and therapy.\n",

      "Abstract:  Retinoic-acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I; also called DDX58) is a cytosolic viral RNA receptor that interacts with MAVS (also called VISA, IPS-1 or Cardif) to induce type I interferon-mediated host protective innate immunity against viral infection. Furthermore, members of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family, which contain a cluster of a RING-finger domain, a B box/coiled-coil domain and a SPRY domain, are involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and antiviral activity. Here we report that the amino-terminal caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) of RIG-I undergo robust ubiquitination induced by TRIM25 in mammalian cells. The carboxy-terminal SPRY domain of TRIM25 interacts with the N-terminal CARDs of RIG-I; this interaction effectively delivers the Lys 63-linked ubiquitin moiety to the N-terminal CARDs of RIG-I, resulting in a marked increase in RIG-I downstream signalling activity. The Lys 172 residue of RIG-I is critical for efficient TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination and for MAVS binding, as well as the ability of RIG-I to induce antiviral signal transduction. Furthermore, gene targeting demonstrates that TRIM25 is essential not only for RIG-I ubiquitination but also for RIG-I-mediated interferon- production and antiviral activity in response to RNA virus infection. Thus, we demonstrate that TRIM25 E3 ubiquitin ligase induces the Lys 63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I, which is crucial for the cytosolic RIG-I signalling pathway to elicit host antiviral innate immunity.\n",

      "Title:  Enteric coronavirus nsp2 is a virulence determinant that recruits NBR1 for autophagic targeting of TBK1 to diminish the innate immune response.\n",
      "Abstract:  Non-structural protein 2 (nsp2) exists in all coronaviruses (CoVs), while its primary function in viral pathogenicity, is largely unclear. One such enteric CoV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), causes high mortality in neonatal piglets worldwide. To determine the biological role of nsp2, we generated a PEDV mutant containing a complete <i>nsp2</i> deletion (rPEDV-Δnsp2) from a highly pathogenic strain by reverse genetics, showing that nsp2 was dispensable for PEDV infection, while its deficiency reduced viral replication <i>in vitro</i>. Intriguingly, rPEDV-Δnsp2 was entirely avirulent <i>in vivo</i>, with significantly increased productions of IFNB (interferon beta) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in various intestinal tissues of challenged newborn piglets. Notably, nsp2 targets and degrades TBK1 (TANK binding kinase 1), the critical kinase in the innate immune response. Mechanistically, nsp2 induced the macroautophagy/autophagy process and recruited a selective autophagic receptor, NBR1 (NBR1 autophagy cargo receptor). NBR1 subsequently facilitated the K48-linked ubiquitination of TBK1 and delivered it for autophagosome-mediated degradation. Accordingly, the replication of rPEDV-Δnsp2 CoV was restrained by reduced autophagy and excess productions of type I IFNs and ISGs. Our data collectively define enteric CoV nsp2 as a novel virulence determinant, propose a crucial role of nsp2 in diminishing innate antiviral immunity by targeting TBK1 for NBR1-mediated selective autophagy, and pave the way to develop a new type of nsp2-based attenuated PEDV vaccine. The study also provides new insights into the prevention and treatment of other pathogenic CoVs.<b>Abbreviations</b>: 3-MA: 3-methyladenine; Baf A1: bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; CoV: coronavirus; CQ: chloroquine; dpi: days post-inoculation; DMVs: double-membrane vesicles; GABARAP: GABA type A receptor-associated protein; GFP: green fluorescent protein; GIGYF2: GRB10 interacting GYF protein 2; hpi: hours post-infection; IFA: immunofluorescence assay; IFIH1: interferon induced with helicase C domain 1; IFIT2: interferon induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2; IFITM1: interferon induced transmembrane protein 1; IFNB: interferon beta; IRF3: interferon regulatory factor 3; ISGs: interferon-stimulated genes; mAb: monoclonal antibody; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MAVS: mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein; NBR1: NBR1 autophagy cargo receptor; nsp2: non-structural protein 2; OAS1: 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1; PEDV: porcine epidemic diarrhea virus; PRRs: pattern recognition receptors; RIGI: RNA sensor RIG-I; RT-qPCR: reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; TBK1: TANK binding kinase 1; TCID<sub>50</sub>: 50% tissue culture infectious doses; VSV: vesicular stomatitis virus.\n",

      "Abstract:  Interferon (IFN) exerts its effects through interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), but its efficacy is limited by interferon resistance, which can be caused by the ubiquitination of key proteins. UBE2O was initially identified as a promising therapeutic target based on data from the TCGA and iUUCD 2.0 databases. Through the inhibition of UBE2O, interferon α/β signaling and overall interferon signaling were activated. Integrating data from proteomic, mass spectrometry, and survival analyses led to the identification of IFIT3, a mediator of interferon signaling, as a ubiquitination substrate of UBE2O. The results of in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the knockdown of UBE2O can enhance the efficacy of interferon-α by upregulating IFIT3 expression. K236 was identified as a ubiquitination site in IFIT3, and the results of rescue experiments confirmed that the effect of UBE2O on interferon-α sensitivity is dependent on IFIT3 activity. ATO treatment inhibited UBE2O and increased IFIT3 expression, thereby increasing the effectiveness of interferon-α. In conclusion, these findings suggest that UBE2O worsens the therapeutic effect of interferon-α by targeting IFIT3 for ubiquitination and degradation.\n",

      "Abstract:  Intracellular double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is a chief sign of replication for many viruses. Host mechanisms detect the dsRNA and initiate antiviral responses. In this report, we identify retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I), which encodes a DExD/H box RNA helicase that contains a caspase recruitment domain, as an essential regulator for dsRNA-induced signaling, as assessed by functional screening and assays. A helicase domain with intact ATPase activity was responsible for the dsRNA-mediated signaling. The caspase recruitment domain transmitted 'downstream' signals, resulting in the activation of transcription factors NF-kappaB and IRF-3. Subsequent gene activation by these factors induced antiviral functions, including type I interferon production. Thus, RIG-I is key in the detection and subsequent eradication of the replicating viral genomes.\n",

      "Abstract:  Inherited genetic factors can influence the severity of COVID-19, but the molecular explanation underpinning a genetic association is often unclear. Intracellular antiviral defenses can inhibit the replication of viruses and reduce disease severity. To better understand the antiviral defenses relevant to COVID-19, we used interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression screening to reveal that 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), through ribonuclease L, potently inhibits severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We show that a common splice-acceptor single-nucleotide polymorphism (Rs10774671) governs whether patients express prenylated OAS1 isoforms that are membrane-associated and sense-specific regions of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs or if they only express cytosolic, nonprenylated OAS1 that does not efficiently detect SARS-CoV-2. In hospitalized patients, expression of prenylated OAS1 was associated with protection from severe COVID-19, suggesting that this antiviral defense is a major component of a protective antiviral response.\n",

While these genes are normally silent in most cell types, their transcription is strongly induced by interferons, virus infection, and molecular patterns such as double-stranded RNA or lipopolysaccharides. The encoded P56 family proteins are characterized by multiple repeats of tetratricopeptide repeat helix-turn-helix motifs mediating a variety of protein-protein interactions, which result in a multitude of effects on cellular and viral functions, such as translation initiation, virus replication, double-stranded RNA signaling, cell migration, and proliferation.\n",

      "Abstract:  Airway-liquid interface cultures of primary epithelial cells and of induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived airway epithelial cells (ALI and iALI, respectively) are physiologically relevant models for respiratory virus infection studies because they can mimic the in vivo human bronchial epithelium. Here, we investigated gene expression profiles in human airway cultures (ALI and iALI models), infected or not with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), using our own and publicly available bulk and single-cell transcriptome datasets. SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly increased the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (<i>IFI44</i>, <i>IFIT1</i>, <i>IFIT3</i>, <i>IFI35</i>, <i>IRF9</i>, <i>MX1</i>, <i>OAS1</i>, <i>OAS3</i> and <i>ISG15</i>) and inflammatory genes (<i>NFKBIA</i>, <i>CSF1</i>, <i>FOSL1</i>, <i>IL32</i> and <i>CXCL10</i>) by day 4 post-infection, indicating activation of the interferon and immune responses to the virus. Extracellular matrix genes (<i>ITGB6</i>, <i>ITGB1</i> and <i>GJA1</i>) were also altered in infected cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing data revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection damaged the respiratory epithelium, particularly mature ciliated cells. The expression of genes encoding intercellular communication and adhesion proteins was also deregulated, suggesting a mechanism to promote shedding of infected epithelial cells. These data demonstrate that ALI/iALI models help to explain the airway epithelium response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and are a key tool for developing COVID-19 treatments.\n",

      "Abstract:  Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a member of the γ-herpesvirus family, can establish latent infection in B lymphocytes and certain epithelial cells after primary infection. Under certain circumstances, EBV can enter into lytic replication. However, the regulation of EBV latent-lytic infection remains largely unclear. The important immune molecule, interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3 (IFIT3), was upregulated in EBV latently infected cells. When the lytic replication of EBV was induced, the expression of IFIT3 was further increased. In turn, IFIT3 overexpression dramatically inhibited the lytic replication of EBV, while IFIT3 knockdown facilitated EBV lytic replication. Moreover, upon the lytic induction, the ectopic IFIT3 expression promoted the activation of the interferon (IFN) pathway, including the production of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), IFNB1, and the phosphorylation of IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). In contrast, the depletion of IFIT3 led to decreased ISGs and IFNB1 expression. Mechanically, IFIT3 inhibited EBV lytic replication through IFN signaling. This study revealed that the host innate immune-related factor IFIT3 played an important role in regulating EBV latent-lytic homeostasis. The results implied that EBV has evolved well to utilize host factors to maintain latent infection.\n",

      "Title:  RIG-I recognizes metabolite-capped RNAs as signaling ligands.\n",
      "Abstract:  The innate immune receptor RIG-I recognizes 5'-triphosphate double-stranded RNAs (5' PPP dsRNA) as pathogenic RNAs. Such RNA-ends are present in viral genomes and replication intermediates, and they activate the RIG-I signaling pathway to produce a potent interferon response essential for viral clearance. Endogenous mRNAs cap the 5' PPP-end with m7G and methylate the 2'-O-ribose to evade RIG-I, preventing aberrant immune responses deleterious to the cell. Recent studies have identified RNAs in cells capped with metabolites such as NAD+, FAD and dephosphoCoA. Whether RIG-I recognizes these metabolite-capped RNAs has not been investigated. Here, we describe a strategy to make metabolite-capped RNAs free from 5' PPP dsRNA contamination, using in vitro transcription initiated with metabolites. Mechanistic studies show that metabolite-capped RNAs have a high affinity for RIG-I, stimulating the ATPase activity at comparable levels to 5' PPP dsRNA. Cellular signaling assays show that the metabolite-capped RNAs potently stimulate the innate antiviral immune response. This demonstrates that RIG-I can tolerate diphosphate-linked, capped RNAs with bulky groups at the 5' RNA end. This novel class of RNAs that stimulate RIG-I signaling may have cellular roles in activating the interferon response and may be exploited with proper functionalities for RIG-I-related RNA therapeutics.\n",

      "Abstract:  Interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) are highly expressed during the cell-intrinsic immune response to viral infection. IFIT1 inhibits translation by binding directly to the 5' end of foreign RNAs, particularly those with non-self cap structures, precluding the recruitment of the cap-binding eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F and ribosome recruitment. The presence of IFIT1 imposes a requirement on viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm to maintain mechanisms to avoid its restrictive effects. Interaction of different IFIT family members is well described, but little is known of the molecular basis of IFIT association or its impact on function. Here, we reconstituted different complexes of IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3 in vitro, which enabled us to reveal critical aspects of IFIT complex assembly. IFIT1 and IFIT3 interact via a YxxxL motif present in the C-terminus of each protein. IFIT2 and IFIT3 homodimers dissociate to form a more stable heterodimer that also associates with IFIT1. We show for the first time that IFIT3 stabilizes IFIT1 protein expression, promotes IFIT1 binding to a cap0 Zika virus reporter mRNA and enhances IFIT1 translation inhibition. This work reveals molecular aspects of IFIT interaction and provides an important missing link between IFIT assembly and function.\n",

In the present study, we find clioquinol (CLQ), an anti-parasitic drug, induces striking myeloma and leukemia cell pyroptosis on a drug screen. RNA sequencing reveals that the interferon-inducible genes IFIT1 and IFIT3 are markedly upregulated and are essential for CLQ-induced GSDME activation and cell pyroptosis. Specifically, IFIT1 and IFIT3 form a complex with BAX and N-GSDME therefore directing N-GSDME translocalization to mitochondria and increasing mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and triggering pyroptosis. Furthermore, venetoclax, an activator of BAX and an inhibitor of Bcl-2, displays strikingly synergistic effects with CLQ against leukemia and myeloma via pyroptosis. This study thus reveals a novel mechanism for mitochondrial GSDME in pyroptosis and it also illustrates that induction of IFIT1/T3 and inhibition of Bcl-2 orchestrate the treatment of leukemia and myeloma via pyroptosis.\n",

Herein, we demonstrated that the mRNA and protein levels of Ifit1, Ifit2 and Ifit3 were highly increased in cultured cells and mouse brains after RABV infection. Recombinant RABV expressing Ifit3, designated rRABV-Ifit3, displayed a lower pathogenicity than the parent RABV in C57BL/6 mice after intramuscular administration, and Ifit3-deficient mice exhibited higher susceptibility to RABV infection and higher mortality during RABV infection. Moreover, compared with their individual expressions, co-expression of Ifit2 and Ifit3 could more effectively inhibit RABV replication <i>in vitro</i>. These results indicate that murine Ifit3 plays an essential role in restricting the replication and reducing the pathogenicity of RABV. Ifit3 acts synergistically with Ifit2 to inhibit RABV replication, providing further insight into the function and complexity of the Ifit family.\n",

The dynamin-like GTPase genes Myxovirus 1 (Mx1) and Mx2 defend mammals against a broad range of viral infections. Loss of Mx1 function in human and mice enhances infectivity by multiple RNA and DNA viruses, including orthomyxoviruses (influenza A), paramyxoviruses (measles), and hepadnaviruses (hepatitis B), whereas loss of Mx2 function leads to decreased resistance to HIV-1 and other viruses. Here we show that both Mx1 and Mx2 have been rendered nonfunctional in Odontoceti cetaceans (toothed whales, including dolphins and orcas). We discovered multiple exon deletions, frameshift mutations, premature stop codons, and transcriptional evidence of decay in the coding sequence of both Mx1 and Mx2 in four species of Odontocetes. We trace the likely loss event for both proteins to soon after the divergence of Odontocetes and Mystocetes (baleen whales) ∼33-37 Mya. Our data raise intriguing questions as to what drove the loss of both Mx1 and Mx2 genes in the Odontoceti lineage, a double loss seen in none of 56 other mammalian genomes, and suggests a hitherto unappreciated fundamental genetic difference in the way these magnificent mammals respond to viral infections.\n",

Recent evidence suggests that the binding of RIG-I to regulatory RNA structures of two major human pathogens, influenza A virus and hepatitis B virus, can inhibit viral replication independent of the subsequent signal transduction. Thus, RIG-I rides a two-pronged attack, with an early-hitting, direct inhibition via occupancy of viral regulatory RNA structures, and a delayed response via signaling and induction of interferons.\n",

      "Abstract:  Although interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT proteins) inhibit infection of many viruses by recognizing their RNA, the regulatory mechanisms involved remain unclear. Here we report a crystal structure of cap 0 (m<sup>7</sup>GpppN) RNA bound to human IFIT1 in complex with the C-terminal domain of human IFIT3. Structural, biochemical, and genetic studies suggest that IFIT3 binding to IFIT1 has dual regulatory functions: (1) extending the half-life of IFIT1 and thereby increasing its steady-state amounts in cells; and (2) allosterically regulating the IFIT1 RNA-binding channel, thereby enhancing the specificity of recognition for cap 0 but not cap 1 (m<sup>7</sup>GpppNm) or 5'-ppp RNA. Mouse Ifit3 lacks this key C-terminal domain and does not bind mouse Ifit1. The IFIT3 interaction with IFIT1 is important for restricting infection of viruses lacking 2'-O methylation in their RNA cap structures.

      "Abstract:  Interferons (IFNs) are one of the hallmarks of host antiviral immunity. IFNs exert their antiviral activities through the induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and antiviral proteins; however, the mechanism by which ISGs inhibit adenovirus (Ad) replication is not clearly understood. IFNs repress Ad immediate early gene expression and, consequently, all subsequent aspects of the viral life cycle. In this study, we found that IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3, IFIT3 (ISG60), restricts Ad replication. IFIT3 repressed Ad E1A immediate early gene expression but did not alter Ad genome entry into the nucleus. Expression of IFIT3 led to phosphorylation of TBK1, IRF3, and STAT1; increased expression of IFNβ and ISGs; and required IFIT1 and IFIT2 partner proteins. During RNA virus infections, it is known that IFIT3 stimulates IFN production through mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS)-mediated activation of TBK1 which synergizes activation of IRF3 and NF-κB. MAVS or TBK1 depletion in cells expressing IFIT3 blocked IFN signaling and reversed the Ad replication restriction. In addition, STING depletion phenocopied the effect suggesting that IFIT3 activates the STING pathway with cross talk to the MAVS pathway. This occurs independently of viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). These results demonstrate that the expression of a single ISG, IFIT3, activates IFN signaling and establishes a cellular antiviral state independent of viral PAMPs. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> IFITs belong to a family of IFN-induced proteins that have broad antiviral functions, primarily studied with RNA viruses leaving a gap of knowledge on the effects of these proteins on DNA viruses. In this study we show that IFIT3, with its partner proteins IFIT1 and IFIT2, specifically restricts replication of human Ad, a DNA virus, by stimulating IFNβ production via the STING and MAVS pathways. This effect enhanced the IFN response and is independent of viral PAMPs. These results reveal a novel mechanism of activation of IFN signaling to enhance cellular antiviral responses.\n",

      "Title:  How Different Pathologies Are Affected by IFIT Expression.\n",
      "Abstract:  The type-I interferon (IFN) system represents the first line of defense against viral pathogens. Recognition of the virus initiates complex signaling pathways that result in the transcriptional induction of IFNs, which are then secreted. Secreted IFNs stimulate nearby cells and result in the production of numerous proinflammatory cytokines and antiviral factors. Of particular note, IFN-induced tetratricopeptide repeat (IFIT) proteins have been thoroughly studied because of their antiviral activity against different viral pathogens. Although classically studied as an antiviral protein, IFIT expression has recently been investigated in the context of nonviral pathologies, such as cancer and sepsis. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), IFIT1 and IFIT3 promote metastasis, while IFIT2 exhibits the opposite effect. The role of IFIT proteins during bacterial/fungal sepsis is still under investigation, with studies showing conflicting roles for IFIT2 in disease severity. In the setting of viral sepsis, IFIT proteins play a key role in clearing viral infection. As a result, many viral pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, employ mechanisms to inhibit the type-I IFN system and promote viral replication. In cancers that are characterized by upregulated IFIT proteins, medications that decrease IFIT expression may reduce metastasis and improve survival rates. Likewise, in cases of viral sepsis, therapeutics that increase IFIT expression may improve viral clearance and reduce the risk of septic shock. By understanding the effect of IFIT proteins in different pathologies, novel therapeutics can be developed to halt disease progression.\n",

We further demonstrated that LOXL2 increased the levels of interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1) and IFIT3 in TW2.6/LOXL2 and FaDu/LOXL2 cells. We also identified IFIT1 and IFIT3 as key downstream components of LOXL2 action in migration, invasion, EMT, and CSC phenotypes in TW2.6 and FaDu cells. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation between LOXL2 expression and IFIT1 and IFIT3 overexpression in human OSCC tissues was observed. In addition, TW2.6/LOXL2 and FaDu/LOXL2 cells were 3.3- to 3.6-fold more susceptible to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor gefitinib than were their respective control cells. The antitumor effect of gefitinib on orthotopic TW2.6/LOXL2 xenograft tumor was fourfold higher than that on controls. Our results indicate that LOXL2 expression is a strong prognostic factor for OSCC and may be used as a marker to identify patients most likely to respond to EGFR-targeted therapy.\n",

      "Abstract:  Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is a neuroviral disease that ranges in severity from a mild febrile illness to a severe and life-threatening meningoencephalitis or encephalomyelitis. There is increasing evidence that susceptibility to tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV)-induced disease and its severity are largely influenced by host genetic factors, in addition to other virus- and host-related factors. In this study, we investigated the contribution of selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in innate immunity genes to predisposition to TBE in humans. More specifically, we investigated a possible association between SNPs rs304478 and rs303212 in the gene Interferon Induced Protein With Tetratricopeptide Repeats 1 (IFIT1), rs7070001 and rs4934470 in the gene Interferon Induced Protein With Tetratricopeptide Repeats 2 (IFIT2), and RIG-I (Retinoic acid-inducible gene I) encoding gene DDX58 rs311795343, rs10813831, rs17217280 and rs3739674 SNPs with predisposition to TBE in population of the Czech Republic, where TBEV is highly endemic. Genotypic and allelic frequencies for these SNPs were analyzed in 247 nonimmunized TBE patients and compared with 204 control subjects. The analysis showed an association of IFIT1 rs304478 SNP and DDX58 rs3739674 and rs17217280 SNPs with predisposition to TBE in the Czech population indicating novel risk factors for clinical TBE but not for disease severity. These results also highlight the role of innate immunity genes in TBE pathogenesis.\n",

      "Abstract:  IFIT1 and IFIT3 are abundant products of interferon-stimulating genes. While the importance of IFIT1 and IFIT3 in the prognosis of cancer has been reported, the molecular basis of IFIT1 and IFIT3 in cancer progression remains unexplored. In the present study, we investigated the modes of action and the clinical significance of IFIT1 and IFIT3 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Ectopic expression of IFIT1 or IFIT3 induced OSCC cell invasion by promoting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, whereas IFIT1 or IFIT3 knockdown exhibited opposite effects. Overexpression of IFIT1 or IFIT3 promoted tumor growth, regional and distant metastasis in xenograft and orthotopic nude mice models. Most importantly, IFIT1 or IFIT3 overexpression increased the levels of p-EGFR<sup>Y1068</sup> and p-AKT<sup>S473</sup> in OSCC cells and also enhanced tumor inhibitory effect of gefitinib. By immunoprecipitation and LC-MS/MS analysis, we found that IFIT1 and IFIT3 interacted with ANXA2 that enhanced p-EGFR<sup>Y1068</sup> endosomal recycling. Depletion of ANXA2 using siRNA therefore abolished p-EGFR<sup>Y1068</sup> and p-AKT<sup>S473</sup> expression in IFIT1- or IFIT3-overexpressed cells. Furthermore, a significant positive association of increased IFIT1 and IFIT3 expression with advanced T-stage, lymph node metastasis, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, extranodal extension, and poor overall survival rate was confirmed in OSCC patients. We also found a statistically positive correlation of p-EGFR<sup>Y1068</sup> expression with IFIT1 and IFIT3 in OSCC tumors and poor clinical outcome in patients. Collectively, we demonstrated a novel role of IFIT1 and IFIT3 in driving OSCC progression and metastasis by interacting with ANXA2 and hence enhancing p-EGFR recycling and its downstream signaling.\n",

      "Abstract:  Dengue virus (DENV) is a type of arthropod-borne Flavivirus, which leads to a series of serious diseases like dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). DENV has a devastating health and economic impact worldwide. However, there are no suitable drugs to combat the virus. Here we reported that HSPA13, also known as stress chaperone (STCH), is a member of the HSP70 family and is a key regulator of type I interferon (IFN-I) and pro-inflammatory responses during DENV infection. HSPA13 expression was increased in macrophages infected with DENV or other Flaviviruses like Zika virus (ZIKV), Yellow fever virus (YFV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Further, HSPA13 suppressed the replication of DENV and other Flaviviruses (ZIKV, JEV, YFV), which exhibited broad-spectrum antiviral effects. On the one hand, HSPA13 promoted production of IFN-β and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs, such as ISG15, OAS and IFIT3) by interacting with RIG-I and up-regulating RIG-I expression during DENV infection. On the other hand, HSPA13 enhanced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion by interacting with ASC in DENV infection. We identified HSPA13 as a potential anti-DENV target. Our results provide clues for the development of antiviral drugs against DENV based on HSPA13 and reveal novel drug target against Flaviviruses.\n",

      "Abstract:  A major component of the protective antiviral host defense is contributed by the intracellular actions of the proteins encoded by interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs); among these are the interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs), consisting of four members in human and three in mouse. IFIT proteins do not have any known enzyme activity. Instead, they inhibit virus replication by binding and regulating the functions of cellular and viral proteins and RNAs. Although all IFITs are comprised of multiple copies of the degenerate tetratricopeptide repeats, their distinct tertiary structures enable them to bind different partners and affect host-virus interactions differently. The recent use of Ifit knockout mouse models has revealed novel antiviral functions of these proteins and new insights into the specificities of ISG actions. This article focuses on human and murine IFIT1 and IFIT2 by reviewing their mechanisms of action, their critical roles in protecting mice from viral pathogenesis, and viral strategies to evade IFIT action.\n",

      "Abstract:  Upon viral infection, the 2', 5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-ribonuclease L (RNaseL) system works to cleave viral RNA, thereby blocking viral replication. However, it is unclear whether OAS proteins have a role in regulating gene expression. Here, we show that OAS1 and OAS3 act as negative regulators of the expression of chemokines and interferonresponsive genes in human macrophages. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease (Cas9) technology was used to engineer human myeloid cell lines in which the OAS1 or OAS3 gene was deleted. Neither OAS1 nor OAS3 was exclusively responsible for the degradation of rRNA in macrophages stimulated with poly(I:C), a synthetic surrogate for viral double-stranded (ds)RNA. An mRNA sequencing analysis revealed that genes related to type I interferon signaling and chemokine activity were increased in OAS1-/- and OAS3-/- macrophages treated with intracellular poly(I:C). Indeed, retinoic-acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I- and interferon-induced helicase C domain-containing protein (IFIH1 or MDA5)-mediated induction of chemokines and interferon-stimulated genes was regulated by OAS3, but Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)- and TLR4-mediated induction of those genes was modulated by OAS1 in macrophages. However, stimulation of these cells with type I interferons had no effect on OAS1- or OAS3-mediated chemokine secretion. These data suggest that OAS1 and OAS3 negatively regulate the expression of chemokines and interferon-responsive genes in human macrophages. [BMB Reports 2019; 52(2): 133-138].\n",

      "Abstract:  Recent evidence has highlighted the role of the innate immune system in type 1 diabetes (T1D) pathogenesis. Specifically, aberrant activation of the interferon response prior to seroconversion of T1D-associated autoantibodies supports a role for the interferon response as a precipitating event toward activation of autoimmunity. Melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), encoded by IFIH1, mediates the innate immune system's interferon response to certain viral species that form double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), the MDA5 ligand, during their life cycle. Extensive research has associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the coding region of IFIH1 with T1D. This review discusses the different risk and protective IFIH1 alleles in the context of recent structural and functional analysis that relate to MDA5 regulation of interferon responses. These studies have provided a functional hypothesis for IFIH1 T1D-associated SNPs' effects on MDA5-mediated interferon responses as well as supporting the genome-wide association (GWA) studies that first associated IFIH1 with T1D.\n",

      "Abstract:  The 2',5' (OASs) are known as mediators of the antiviral response system through activation of the RNA cleavage pathway. Interestingly, we observe OAS1, OAS2 and OAS3 upregulation in a number of gene expression signatures which discriminate active TB from latent TB infection, however their biological role during bacterial infection has not yet been elucidated. We observed that the expression of these genes was associated with pathogenicity and virulence of mycobacteria as infection with Mycobacterium bovis BCG failed to significantly induce OAS expression. Further, we observed that after silencing of these genes, M. tb CFU counts increased significantly 96h post-infection in comparison to the respective controls. Luminex revealed that OAS silencing significantly decreased IL-1β, TNF-α and MCP-1 and had no effect of IL-10 secretion. We show for the first time that OAS1, 2 and 3 restrict intracellular pathogenic mycobacterial replication and enhance pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion.\n",

      "Abstract:  Astrocytes are a heterogeneous population of central nervous system glial cells that respond to pathological insults and injury by undergoing a transformation called \"reactivity.\" Reactive astrocytes exhibit distinct and context-dependent cellular, molecular, and functional state changes that can either support or disturb tissue homeostasis. We recently identified a reactive astrocyte sub-state defined by interferon-responsive genes like Igtp, Ifit3, Mx1, and others, called interferon-responsive reactive astrocytes (IRRAs). To further this transcriptomic definition of IRRAs, we wanted to define the proteomic changes that occur in this reactive sub-state. We induced IRRAs in immunopanned rodent astrocytes and human iPSC-differentiated astrocytes using TNF, IL1α, C1Q, and IFNβ and characterized their proteomic profile (both cellular and secreted) using unbiased quantitative proteomics. We identified 2335 unique cellular proteins, including IFIT2/3, IFITM3, OASL1/2, MX1/2/3, and STAT1. We also report that rodent and human IRRAs secrete PAI1, a serine protease inhibitor which may influence reactive states and functions of nearby cells. Finally, we evaluated how IRRAs are distinct from neurotoxic reactive astrocytes (NRAs). While NRAs are described by expression of the complement protein C3, it was not upregulated in IRRAs. Instead, we found ~90 proteins unique to IRRAs not identified in NRAs, including OAS1A, IFIT3, and MX1. Interferon signaling in astrocytes is critical for the antiviral immune response and for regulating synaptic plasticity and glutamate transport mechanisms. How IRRAs contribute to these functions is unknown. This study provides the basis for future experiments to define the functional roles of IRRAs in the context of neurodegenerative disorders.\n",

MDA5 is one such sensor of virus presence and is activated by RNA. MDA5 is required for immunity against several classes of viruses, including picornaviruses. Recent work showed that mutations in the IFIH1 gene, encoding MDA5, lead to interferon-driven autoinflammatory diseases. Together with observations made in cancer cells, this suggests that MDA5 detects cellular RNAs in addition to viral RNAs. It is therefore important to understand the properties of the RNAs which activate MDA5. New data indicate that RNA length and secondary structure are features sensed by MDA5. We review these developments and discuss how MDA5 strikes a balance between antiviral immunity and autoinflammation.\n",

      "Abstract:  Analysis of autoinflammatory and immunodeficiency disorders elucidates human immunity and fosters the development of targeted therapies. Oligoadenylate synthetase 1 is a type I interferon-induced, intracellular double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensor that generates 2'-5'-oligoadenylate to activate ribonuclease L (RNase L) as a means of antiviral defense. We identified four de novo heterozygous <i>OAS1</i> gain-of-function variants in six patients with a polymorphic autoinflammatory immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent fever, dermatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, and hypogammaglobulinemia. To establish causality, we applied genetic, molecular dynamics simulation, biochemical, and cellular functional analyses in heterologous, autologous, and inducible pluripotent stem cell-derived macrophages and/or monocytes and B cells. We found that upon interferon-induced expression, OAS1 variant proteins displayed dsRNA-independent activity, which resulted in RNase L-mediated RNA cleavage, transcriptomic alteration, translational arrest, and dysfunction and apoptosis of monocytes, macrophages, and B cells. RNase L inhibition with curcumin modulated and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation cured the disorder. Together, these data suggest that human OAS1 is a regulator of interferon-induced hyperinflammatory monocyte, macrophage, and B cell pathophysiology.\n",

      "Abstract:  Cells infected by influenza virus mount a large-scale antiviral response and most cells ultimately initiate cell-death pathways in an attempt to suppress viral replication. We performed a CRISPR-Cas9-knockout selection designed to identify host factors required for replication after viral entry. We identified a large class of presumptive antiviral factors that unexpectedly act as important proviral enhancers during influenza virus infection. One of these, IFIT2, is an interferon-stimulated gene with well-established antiviral activity but limited mechanistic understanding. As opposed to suppressing infection, we show in the present study that IFIT2 is instead repurposed by influenza virus to promote viral gene expression. CLIP-seq demonstrated that IFIT2 binds directly to viral and cellular messenger RNAs in AU-rich regions, with bound cellular transcripts enriched in interferon-stimulated mRNAs. Polysome and ribosome profiling revealed that IFIT2 prevents ribosome pausing on bound mRNAs. Together, the data link IFIT2 binding to enhanced translational efficiency for viral and cellular mRNAs and ultimately viral replication. Our findings establish a model for the normal function of IFIT2 as a protein that increases translation of cellular mRNAs to support antiviral responses and explain how influenza virus uses this same activity to redirect a classically antiviral protein into a proviral effector.\n",

On the contrary, different strategies adopted to suppress a set of IRDS genes (STAT1, IRF7, OAS family, and BST2) to induce (chemo- and radiotherapy) sensitivity were deliberated. Significant biological pathways that comprise these genes were classified, along with their frequently associated genes (IFIT1/3, IFITM1, IRF7, ISG15, MX1/2 and OAS1/3/L). Major upstream regulators from the IRDS genes were identified, and different IFN types regulating these genes were outlined. Functional interfaces of IRDS proteins with DNA/RNA/ATP/GTP/NADP biomolecules featured a well-defined pharmacophore model for STAT1/IRF7-dsDNA and OAS1/OAS3/IFIH1-dsRNA complexes, as well as for the genes binding to GDP or NADP+. The Lys amino acid was found commonly interacting with the ATP phosphate group from OAS1/EIF2AK2/IFIH1 genes.

Our study aims to explore key regulators underlying psoriasis and potential targets for psoriasis treatment. RNA-seq data of psoriasis and normal tissues were extracted from Gene Expression Omnibus database to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was conducted to identify key gene modules correlated with psoriasis. Enrichment analysis was used to characterize identified genes. The expression of identified genes was verified in a data set with various types of psoriasis lesion tissues and six psoriasis and healthy control tissues by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry assays. And the biological functions of IFIT3 in keratinocytes were determined by colony formation assays, Cell Counting Kit-8, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. A total of 594 overlapped genes (370 upregulated and 224 downregulated) were selected as DEGs between psoriasis and normal tissues in three independent data sets. These genes were enriched in interferon-related pathway and cytokine-related pathway. Weighted correlation network analysis identified several gene modules that were associated with psoriasis. Overlapped genes between gene modules and DEGs were associated with interferon-related pathway and T cell activities. Among these genes, OAS1, USP18, and IFIT3 had higher expression levels in psoriasis vulgaris (PV) and nonpustular palmoplantar psoriasis (NPPP) tissues but not Palmoplantar Pustular Psoriasis (PPPP). Meanwhile, these results were confirmed in our independent psoriasis tissue cohort. And results of in vitro experiments showed that inhibition of IFIT3 significantly impaired the proliferation capacity and CXCL1, CCL20, IL-1β, and IL-6 secretion of keratinocytes. Our study identified key genes and pathways underlying the pathogenesis of psoriasis through the conduct of integrated analysis. OAS1, USP18, and IFIT3 could be potential targets for the treatment of psoriasis. IFIT3 can promote the proliferation and immune activation of keratinocytes and facilitates the development of psoriasis.\n",

Considering the premise that targeting IRDS genes mediated resistance offers an efficient strategy to resensitize tumour cells and enhances the outcome of anti-cancer treatment, this review can add some novel insights to the field.\n",

      "Airway-liquid interface cultures of primary epithelial cells and of induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived airway epithelial cells (ALI and iALI, respectively) are physiologically relevant models for respiratory virus infection studies because they can mimic the in vivo human bronchial epithelium. Here, we investigated gene expression profiles in human airway cultures (ALI and iALI models), infected or not with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), using our own and publicly available bulk and single-cell transcriptome datasets. SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly increased the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (<i>IFI44</i>, <i>IFIT1</i>, <i>IFIT3</i>, <i>IFI35</i>, <i>IRF9</i>, <i>MX1</i>, <i>OAS1</i>, <i>OAS3</i> and <i>ISG15</i>) and inflammatory genes (<i>NFKBIA</i>, <i>CSF1</i>, <i>FOSL1</i>, <i>IL32</i> and <i>CXCL10</i>) by day 4 post-infection, indicating activation of the interferon and immune responses to the virus. Extracellular matrix genes (<i>ITGB6</i>, <i>ITGB1</i> and <i>GJA1</i>) were also altered in infected cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing data revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection damaged the respiratory epithelium, particularly mature ciliated cells. The expression of genes encoding intercellular communication and adhesion proteins was also deregulated, suggesting a mechanism to promote shedding of infected epithelial cells. These data demonstrate that ALI/iALI models help to explain the airway epithelium response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and are a key tool for developing COVID-19 treatments.\n",

      "Non-structural protein 2 (nsp2) exists in all coronaviruses (CoVs), while its primary function in viral pathogenicity, is largely unclear. One such enteric CoV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), causes high mortality in neonatal piglets worldwide. To determine the biological role of nsp2, we generated a PEDV mutant containing a complete <i>nsp2</i> deletion (rPEDV-Δnsp2) from a highly pathogenic strain by reverse genetics, showing that nsp2 was dispensable for PEDV infection, while its deficiency reduced viral replication <i>in vitro</i>. Intriguingly, rPEDV-Δnsp2 was entirely avirulent <i>in vivo</i>, with significantly increased productions of IFNB (interferon beta) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in various intestinal tissues of challenged newborn piglets. Notably, nsp2 targets and degrades TBK1 (TANK binding kinase 1), the critical kinase in the innate immune response. Mechanistically, nsp2 induced the macroautophagy/autophagy process and recruited a selective autophagic receptor, NBR1 (NBR1 autophagy cargo receptor). NBR1 subsequently facilitated the K48-linked ubiquitination of TBK1 and delivered it for autophagosome-mediated degradation. Accordingly, the replication of rPEDV-Δnsp2 CoV was restrained by reduced autophagy and excess productions of type I IFNs and ISGs. Our data collectively define enteric CoV nsp2 as a novel virulence determinant, propose a crucial role of nsp2 in diminishing innate antiviral immunity by targeting TBK1 for NBR1-mediated selective autophagy, and pave the way to develop a new type of nsp2-based attenuated PEDV vaccine. The study also provides new insights into the prevention and treatment of other pathogenic CoVs.<b>Abbreviations</b>: 3-MA: 3-methyladenine; Baf A1: bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; CoV: coronavirus; CQ: chloroquine; dpi: days post-inoculation; DMVs: double-membrane vesicles; GABARAP: GABA type A receptor-associated protein; GFP: green fluorescent protein; GIGYF2: GRB10 interacting GYF protein 2; hpi: hours post-infection; IFA: immunofluorescence assay; IFIH1: interferon induced with helicase C domain 1; IFIT2: interferon induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2; IFITM1: interferon induced transmembrane protein 1; IFNB: interferon beta; IRF3: interferon regulatory factor 3; ISGs: interferon-stimulated genes; mAb: monoclonal antibody; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MAVS: mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein; NBR1: NBR1 autophagy cargo receptor; nsp2: non-structural protein 2; OAS1: 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1; PEDV: porcine epidemic diarrhea virus; PRRs: pattern recognition receptors; RIGI: RNA sensor RIG-I; RT-qPCR: reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; TBK1: TANK binding kinase 1; TCID<sub>50</sub>: 50% tissue culture infectious doses; VSV: vesicular stomatitis virus.\n",

      "Upon viral infection, the 2', 5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-ribonuclease L (RNaseL) system works to cleave viral RNA, thereby blocking viral replication. However, it is unclear whether OAS proteins have a role in regulating gene expression. Here, we show that OAS1 and OAS3 act as negative regulators of the expression of chemokines and interferonresponsive genes in human macrophages. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease (Cas9) technology was used to engineer human myeloid cell lines in which the OAS1 or OAS3 gene was deleted. Neither OAS1 nor OAS3 was exclusively responsible for the degradation of rRNA in macrophages stimulated with poly(I:C), a synthetic surrogate for viral double-stranded (ds)RNA. An mRNA sequencing analysis revealed that genes related to type I interferon signaling and chemokine activity were increased in OAS1-/- and OAS3-/- macrophages treated with intracellular poly(I:C). Indeed, retinoic-acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I- and interferon-induced helicase C domain-containing protein (IFIH1 or MDA5)-mediated induction of chemokines and interferon-stimulated genes was regulated by OAS3, but Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)- and TLR4-mediated induction of those genes was modulated by OAS1 in macrophages. However, stimulation of these cells with type I interferons had no effect on OAS1- or OAS3-mediated chemokine secretion. These data suggest that OAS1 and OAS3 negatively regulate the expression of chemokines and interferon-responsive genes in human macrophages. [BMB Reports 2019; 52(2): 133-138].\n",

      "The excessive activation of immune responses will trigger autoimmune diseases or inflammatory injury. The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) system can capture and mediate ubiquitinated protein degradation, which timely terminates signaling pathway hyperactivation. However, whether the ESCRT system participates in regulating RIGI-like receptor (RLR)-mediated antiviral responses remains unknown. In this study, we show that LTN1/listerin, a major component of RQC, can recruit E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM27 to trigger K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIGI and IFIH1/MDA5. This K63-linked polyubiquitination facilitates the sorting and degradation of RIGI and IFIH1 proteins through the ESCRT-dependent pathway. Concordantly, LTN1 deficiency enhances the innate antiviral response to infection with RNA viruses. Thus, our work uncovers a new mechanism for RIGI and IFIH1 degradation and identifies the role of LTN1 in negatively regulating RLR-mediated antiviral innate immunity, which may provide new targets for the intervention of viral infection.<b>Abbreviation</b>: 5'-pppRNA: 5' triphosphate double stranded RNA; ATG5: autophagy related 5; ATG7: autophagy related 7; BafA1: bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; ESCRT: endosomal sorting complexes required for transport; CHX: cycloheximide; IFIH1/MDA5: interferon induced with helicase C domain 1; IFN: interferon; PIK3C3/VPS34: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3; RIGI: RNA sensor RIG-I; RLR: RIGI-like receptors; RQC: ribosome-associated protein quality control; SeV: Sendai virus; TRIM27: tripartite motif-containing 27; VSV: vesicular stomatitis virus; VPS4: vacuolar protein sorting 4.\n",

      "The type I interferon response protects cells against invading viral pathogens. The cellular factors that mediate this defence are the products of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Although hundreds of ISGs have been identified since their discovery more than 25 years ago, only a few have been characterized with respect to antiviral activity. For most ISG products, little is known about their antiviral potential, their target specificity and their mechanisms of action. Using an overexpression screening approach, here we show that different viruses are targeted by unique sets of ISGs. We find that each viral species is susceptible to multiple antiviral genes, which together encompass a range of inhibitory activities. To conduct the screen, more than 380 human ISGs were tested for their ability to inhibit the replication of several important human and animal viruses, including hepatitis C virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, chikungunya virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and human immunodeficiency virus type-1. Broadly acting effectors included IRF1, C6orf150 (also known as MB21D1), HPSE, RIG-I (also known as DDX58), MDA5 (also known as IFIH1) and IFITM3, whereas more targeted antiviral specificity was observed with DDX60, IFI44L, IFI6, IFITM2, MAP3K14, MOV10, NAMPT (also known as PBEF1), OASL, RTP4, TREX1 and UNC84B (also known as SUN2). Combined expression of pairs of ISGs showed additive antiviral effects similar to those of moderate type I interferon doses. Mechanistic studies uncovered a common theme of translational inhibition for numerous effectors. Several ISGs, including ADAR, FAM46C, LY6E and MCOLN2, enhanced the replication of certain viruses, highlighting another layer of complexity in the highly pleiotropic type I interferon system.\n",

      "The innate immune system senses nucleic acids by germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors. RNA is sensed by Toll-like receptor members TLR3, TLR7 and TLR8, or by the RNA helicases RIG-I (also known as DDX58) and MDA-5 (IFIH1). Little is known about sensors for cytoplasmic DNA that trigger antiviral and/or inflammatory responses. The best characterized of these responses involves activation of the TANK-binding kinase (TBK1)-interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) signalling axis to trigger transcriptional induction of type I interferon genes. A second, less well-defined pathway leads to the activation of an 'inflammasome' that, via caspase-1, controls the catalytic cleavage of the pro-forms of the cytokines IL1beta and IL18 (refs 6, 7). Using mouse and human cells, here we identify the PYHIN (pyrin and HIN domain-containing protein) family member absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) as a receptor for cytosolic DNA, which regulates caspase-1. The HIN200 domain of AIM2 binds to DNA, whereas the pyrin domain (but not that of the other PYHIN family members) associates with the adaptor molecule ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain) to activate both NF-kappaB and caspase-1. Knockdown of Aim2 abrogates caspase-1 activation in response to cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA and the double-stranded DNA vaccinia virus. Collectively, these observations identify AIM2 as a new receptor for cytoplasmic DNA, which forms an inflammasome with the ligand and ASC to activate caspase-1.\n",

      "Induction of interferons during viral infection is mediated by cellular proteins that recognise viral nucleic acids. MDA5 is one such sensor of virus presence and is activated by RNA. MDA5 is required for immunity against several classes of viruses, including picornaviruses. Recent work showed that mutations in the IFIH1 gene, encoding MDA5, lead to interferon-driven autoinflammatory diseases. Together with observations made in cancer cells, this suggests that MDA5 detects cellular RNAs in addition to viral RNAs. It is therefore important to understand the properties of the RNAs which activate MDA5. New data indicate that RNA length and secondary structure are features sensed by MDA5. We review these developments and discuss how MDA5 strikes a balance between antiviral immunity and autoinflammation.\n",

      "Abstract:  RIG-I and MDA5 are well-conserved cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors that detect viral RNAs during infection and activate the type I interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral immune response. While much is known about how these receptors recognize viral RNAs, how they interact with their common signaling adaptor molecule MAVS and activate the downstream signaling pathway had been less clear. Previous studies have shown that the signaling domains (tandem CARDs or 2CARDs) of RIG-I and MDA5 must form homo-oligomers in order to interact with MAVS, and that their interactions lead to filament formation of MAVS, a pre-requisite for downstream signal activation. More recent data suggest that multiple mechanisms synergistically promote tetramer formation of RIG-I 2CARD, and that this tetramer resembles a lock-washer, which serves as a helical template to nucleate the MAVS filament. We here summarize these recent findings and discuss the current understanding of the signal activation mechanisms of RIG-I and MDA5.\n",

Although hundreds of ISGs have been identified since their discovery more than 25 years ago, only a few have been characterized with respect to antiviral activity. For most ISG products, little is known about their antiviral potential, their target specificity and their mechanisms of action. Using an overexpression screening approach, here we show that different viruses are targeted by unique sets of ISGs. We find that each viral species is susceptible to multiple antiviral genes, which together encompass a range of inhibitory activities. To conduct the screen, more than 380 human ISGs were tested for their ability to inhibit the replication of several important human and animal viruses, including hepatitis C virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, chikungunya virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and human immunodeficiency virus type-1. Broadly acting effectors included IRF1, C6orf150 (also known as MB21D1), HPSE, RIG-I (also known as DDX58), MDA5 (also known as IFIH1) and IFITM3, whereas more targeted antiviral specificity was observed with DDX60, IFI44L, IFI6, IFITM2, MAP3K14, MOV10, NAMPT (also known as PBEF1), OASL, RTP4, TREX1 and UNC84B (also known as SUN2). Combined expression of pairs of ISGs showed additive antiviral effects similar to those of moderate type I interferon doses. Mechanistic studies uncovered a common theme of translational inhibition for numerous effectors. Several ISGs, including ADAR, FAM46C, LY6E and MCOLN2, enhanced the replication of certain viruses, highlighting another layer of complexity in the highly pleiotropic type I interferon system.\n",

      "Abstract:  Our understanding of how global changes in cellular metabolism contribute to human kidney disease remains incompletely understood. Here we show that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) deficiency drives mitochondrial dysfunction causing inflammation and kidney disease development. Using unbiased global metabolomics in healthy and diseased human kidneys, we identify NAD<sup>+</sup> deficiency as a disease signature. Furthermore using models of cisplatin- or ischaemia-reperfusion induced kidney injury in male mice we observed NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion Supplemental nicotinamide riboside or nicotinamide mononucleotide restores NAD<sup>+</sup> levels and improved kidney function. We find that cisplatin exposure causes cytosolic leakage of mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) and activation of the cytosolic pattern recognition receptor retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), both of which can be ameliorated by restoring NAD<sup>+</sup>. Male mice with RIG-I knock-out (KO) are protected from cisplatin-induced kidney disease. In summary, we demonstrate that the cytosolic release of mtRNA and RIG-I activation is an NAD<sup>+</sup>-sensitive mechanism contributing to kidney disease.\n",

      "Abstract:  The retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) receptor senses cytoplasmic viral RNA and activates type I interferons (IFN-I) and downstream antiviral immune responses. How RIG-I binds to viral RNA and how its activation is regulated remains unclear. Here, using IFI16 knockout cells and p204-deficient mice, we demonstrate that the DNA sensor IFI16 enhances IFN-I production to inhibit influenza A virus (IAV) replication. IFI16 positively upregulates RIG-I transcription through direct binding to and recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the RIG-I promoter. IFI16 also binds to influenza viral RNA via its HINa domain and to RIG-I protein with its PYRIN domain, thus promoting IAV-induced K63-linked polyubiquitination and RIG-I activation. Our work demonstrates that IFI16 is a positive regulator of RIG-I signalling during influenza virus infection, highlighting its role in the RIG-I-like-receptor-mediated innate immune response to IAV and other RNA viruses, and suggesting its possible exploitation to modulate the antiviral response.\n",

      "Abstract:  Recognition of viral RNA by the retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) initiates innate antiviral immune response. How the binding of viral RNA to and activation of the RLRs are regulated remains enigmatic. In this study, we identified ZCCHC3 as a positive regulator of the RLRs including RIG-I and MDA5. ZCCHC3 deficiency markedly inhibited RNA virus-triggered induction of downstream antiviral genes, and ZCCHC3-deficient mice were more susceptible to RNA virus infection. ZCCHC3 was associated with RIG-I and MDA5 and functions in two distinct processes for regulation of RIG-I and MDA5 activities. ZCCHC3 bound to dsRNA and enhanced the binding of RIG-I and MDA5 to dsRNA. ZCCHC3 also recruited the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 to the RIG-I and MDA5 complexes to facilitate its K63-linked polyubiquitination and activation. Thus, ZCCHC3 is a co-receptor for RIG-I and MDA5, which is critical for RLR-mediated innate immune response to RNA virus.\n",

      "Abstract:  The excessive activation of immune responses will trigger autoimmune diseases or inflammatory injury. The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) system can capture and mediate ubiquitinated protein degradation, which timely terminates signaling pathway hyperactivation. However, whether the ESCRT system participates in regulating RIGI-like receptor (RLR)-mediated antiviral responses remains unknown. In this study, we show that LTN1/listerin, a major component of RQC, can recruit E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM27 to trigger K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIGI and IFIH1/MDA5. This K63-linked polyubiquitination facilitates the sorting and degradation of RIGI and IFIH1 proteins through the ESCRT-dependent pathway. Concordantly, LTN1 deficiency enhances the innate antiviral response to infection with RNA viruses. Thus, our work uncovers a new mechanism for RIGI and IFIH1 degradation and identifies the role of LTN1 in negatively regulating RLR-mediated antiviral innate immunity, which may provide new targets for the intervention of viral infection.<b>Abbreviation</b>: 5'-pppRNA: 5' triphosphate double stranded RNA; ATG5: autophagy related 5; ATG7: autophagy related 7; BafA1: bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; ESCRT: endosomal sorting complexes required for transport; CHX: cycloheximide; IFIH1/MDA5: interferon induced with helicase C domain 1; IFN: interferon; PIK3C3/VPS34: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3; RIGI: RNA sensor RIG-I; RLR: RIGI-like receptors; RQC: ribosome-associated protein quality control; SeV: Sendai virus; TRIM27: tripartite motif-containing 27; VSV: vesicular stomatitis virus; VPS4: vacuolar protein sorting 4.\n",

      "Abstract:  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease with highly heterogeneous clinical symptoms and severity. There is complex pathogenesis of SLE, one of which is IFNs overproduction and downstream IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) upregulation. Identifying the key ISGs differentially expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with SLE and healthy people could help to further understand the role of the IFN pathway in SLE and discover potential diagnostic biomarkers. The differentially expressed ISGs (DEISG) in PBMCs of SLE patients and healthy persons were screened from two datasets of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. A total of 67 DEISGs, including 6 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and 61 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were identified by the \"DESeq2\" R package. According to Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, those DEISGs were mainly concentrated in the response to virus and immune system processes. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network showed that most of these DEISGs could interact strongly with each other. Then, IFIT1, RSAD2, IFIT3, USP18, ISG15, OASL, MX1, OAS2, OAS3, and IFI44 were considered to be hub ISGs in SLE by \"MCODE\" and \"Cytohubba\" plugins of Cytoscape, Moreover, the results of expression correlation suggested that 3 lncRNAs (NRIR, FAM225A, and LY6E-DT) were closely related to the IFN pathway. The lncRNA NRIR and mRNAs (RSAD2, USP18, IFI44, and ISG15) were selected as candidate ISGs for verification. RT-qPCR results showed that PBMCs from SLE patients had substantially higher expression levels of 5 ISGs compared to healthy controls (HCs). Additionally, statistical analyses revealed that the expression levels of these ISGs were strongly associated to various clinical symptoms, including thrombocytopenia and facial erythema, as well as laboratory indications, including the white blood cell (WBC) count and levels of autoantibodies. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve demonstrated that the IFI44, USP18, RSAD2, and IFN score had good diagnostic capabilities of SLE. According to our study, SLE was associated with ISGs including NRIR, RSAD2, USP18, IFI44, and ISG15, which may contribute to the future diagnosis and new personalized targeted therapies.\n",

      "Abstract:  The innate immune system senses nucleic acids by germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors. RNA is sensed by Toll-like receptor members TLR3, TLR7 and TLR8, or by the RNA helicases RIG-I (also known as DDX58) and MDA-5 (IFIH1). Little is known about sensors for cytoplasmic DNA that trigger antiviral and/or inflammatory responses. The best characterized of these responses involves activation of the TANK-binding kinase (TBK1)-interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) signalling axis to trigger transcriptional induction of type I interferon genes. A second, less well-defined pathway leads to the activation of an 'inflammasome' that, via caspase-1, controls the catalytic cleavage of the pro-forms of the cytokines IL1beta and IL18 (refs 6, 7). Using mouse and human cells, here we identify the PYHIN (pyrin and HIN domain-containing protein) family member absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) as a receptor for cytosolic DNA, which regulates caspase-1. The HIN200 domain of AIM2 binds to DNA, whereas the pyrin domain (but not that of the other PYHIN family members) associates with the adaptor molecule ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain) to activate both NF-kappaB and caspase-1. Knockdown of Aim2 abrogates caspase-1 activation in response to cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA and the double-stranded DNA vaccinia virus. Collectively, these observations identify AIM2 as a new receptor for cytoplasmic DNA, which forms an inflammasome with the ligand and ASC to activate caspase-1.\n",

      "Abstract:  The interferon-inducible protein with tetrapeptide repeats 3 (IFIT3) is one of the most important members in both the IFIT family and interferon-stimulated genes family. IFIT3 has typical features of the IFIT family in terms of gene and protein structures, and is able to be activated through the classical PRRs-IFN-JAK/STAT pathway. A variety of viruses can induce the expression of IFIT3, which in turn inhibits the replication of viruses, with the underlying mechanism showing its crucial role in antiviral innate immunity. Emerging studies have also identified that IFIT3 is involved in cellular biology changes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and cancer development. In this review, we summarize the characteristics of IFIT3 with respect to molecular structure and regulatory pathways, highlighting the role of IFIT3 in antiviral innate immunity, as well as its diverse biological roles. We also discuss the potential of IFIT3 as a biomarker in disease diagnosis and therapy.\n",

      "Abstract:  Non-structural protein 2 (nsp2) exists in all coronaviruses (CoVs), while its primary function in viral pathogenicity, is largely unclear. One such enteric CoV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), causes high mortality in neonatal piglets worldwide. To determine the biological role of nsp2, we generated a PEDV mutant containing a complete <i>nsp2</i> deletion (rPEDV-Δnsp2) from a highly pathogenic strain by reverse genetics, showing that nsp2 was dispensable for PEDV infection, while its deficiency reduced viral replication <i>in vitro</i>. Intriguingly, rPEDV-Δnsp2 was entirely avirulent <i>in vivo</i>, with significantly increased productions of IFNB (interferon beta) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in various intestinal tissues of challenged newborn piglets. Notably, nsp2 targets and degrades TBK1 (TANK binding kinase 1), the critical kinase in the innate immune response. Mechanistically, nsp2 induced the macroautophagy/autophagy process and recruited a selective autophagic receptor, NBR1 (NBR1 autophagy cargo receptor). NBR1 subsequently facilitated the K48-linked ubiquitination of TBK1 and delivered it for autophagosome-mediated degradation. Accordingly, the replication of rPEDV-Δnsp2 CoV was restrained by reduced autophagy and excess productions of type I IFNs and ISGs. Our data collectively define enteric CoV nsp2 as a novel virulence determinant, propose a crucial role of nsp2 in diminishing innate antiviral immunity by targeting TBK1 for NBR1-mediated selective autophagy, and pave the way to develop a new type of nsp2-based attenuated PEDV vaccine. The study also provides new insights into the prevention and treatment of other pathogenic CoVs.<b>Abbreviations</b>: 3-MA: 3-methyladenine; Baf A1: bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; CoV: coronavirus; CQ: chloroquine; dpi: days post-inoculation; DMVs: double-membrane vesicles; GABARAP: GABA type A receptor-associated protein; GFP: green fluorescent protein; GIGYF2: GRB10 interacting GYF protein 2; hpi: hours post-infection; IFA: immunofluorescence assay; IFIH1: interferon induced with helicase C domain 1; IFIT2: interferon induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2; IFITM1: interferon induced transmembrane protein 1; IFNB: interferon beta; IRF3: interferon regulatory factor 3; ISGs: interferon-stimulated genes; mAb: monoclonal antibody; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MAVS: mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein; NBR1: NBR1 autophagy cargo receptor; nsp2: non-structural protein 2; OAS1: 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1; PEDV: porcine epidemic diarrhea virus; PRRs: pattern recognition receptors; RIGI: RNA sensor RIG-I; RT-qPCR: reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; TBK1: TANK binding kinase 1; TCID<sub>50</sub>: 50% tissue culture infectious doses; VSV: vesicular stomatitis virus.\n",

      "Abstract:  Inherited genetic factors can influence the severity of COVID-19, but the molecular explanation underpinning a genetic association is often unclear. Intracellular antiviral defenses can inhibit the replication of viruses and reduce disease severity. To better understand the antiviral defenses relevant to COVID-19, we used interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression screening to reveal that 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), through ribonuclease L, potently inhibits severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We show that a common splice-acceptor single-nucleotide polymorphism (Rs10774671) governs whether patients express prenylated OAS1 isoforms that are membrane-associated and sense-specific regions of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs or if they only express cytosolic, nonprenylated OAS1 that does not efficiently detect SARS-CoV-2. In hospitalized patients, expression of prenylated OAS1 was associated with protection from severe COVID-19, suggesting that this antiviral defense is a major component of a protective antiviral response.\n",

We report on 374 patients from 299 families with mutations in these seven genes. Most patients conformed to one of two fairly stereotyped clinical profiles; either exhibiting an in utero disease-onset (74 patients; 22.8% of all patients where data were available), or a post-natal presentation, usually within the first year of life (223 patients; 68.6%), characterized by a sub-acute encephalopathy and a loss of previously acquired skills. Other clinically distinct phenotypes were also observed; particularly, bilateral striatal necrosis (13 patients; 3.6%) and non-syndromic spastic paraparesis (12 patients; 3.4%). We recorded 69 deaths (19.3% of patients with follow-up data). Of 285 patients for whom data were available, 210 (73.7%) were profoundly disabled, with no useful motor, speech and intellectual function. Chilblains, glaucoma, hypothyroidism, cardiomyopathy, intracerebral vasculitis, peripheral neuropathy, bowel inflammation and systemic lupus erythematosus were seen frequently enough to be confirmed as real associations with the Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome phenotype. We observed a robust relationship between mutations in all seven genes with increased type I interferon activity in cerebrospinal fluid and serum, and the increased expression of interferon-stimulated gene transcripts in peripheral blood. We recorded a positive correlation between the level of cerebrospinal fluid interferon activity assayed within one year of disease presentation and the degree of subsequent disability. Interferon-stimulated gene transcripts remained high in most patients, indicating an ongoing disease process. On the basis of substantial morbidity and mortality, our data highlight the urgent need to define coherent treatment strategies for the phenotypes associated with mutations in the Aicardi-Goutières syndrome-related genes. Our findings also make it clear that a window of therapeutic opportunity exists relevant to the majority of affected patients and indicate that the assessment of type I interferon activity might serve as a useful biomarker in future clinical trials.\n",

RIG-I is a cytoplasmic RNA helicase that is able to bind virus-specific RNA structures. Activated RIG-I switches into a conformation that locks the ligand RNA and signals via the MAVS-IRF-3 axis, resulting in the upregulation of antiviral interferons. Recent evidence suggests that the binding of RIG-I to regulatory RNA structures of two major human pathogens, influenza A virus and hepatitis B virus, can inhibit viral replication independent of the subsequent signal transduction. Thus, RIG-I rides a two-pronged attack, with an early-hitting, direct inhibition via occupancy of viral regulatory RNA structures, and a delayed response via signaling and induction of interferons.\n",

Detection of viral RNA also activates stress responses resulting in stress granule-like aggregates, which facilitate RLR-mediated antiviral immunity. Among the three RLR family members RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) recognize distinct viral RNA species with differential molecular machinery and activate signaling through mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS, also known as IPS-1/VISA/Cardif), which leads to the expression of cytokines including type I and III interferons (IFNs) to restrict viral propagation.

      "Abstract:  Interferon (IFN) exerts its effects through interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), but its efficacy is limited by interferon resistance, which can be caused by the ubiquitination of key proteins. UBE2O was initially identified as a promising therapeutic target based on data from the TCGA and iUUCD 2.0 databases. Through the inhibition of UBE2O, interferon α/β signaling and overall interferon signaling were activated. Integrating data from proteomic, mass spectrometry, and survival analyses led to the identification of IFIT3, a mediator of interferon signaling, as a ubiquitination substrate of UBE2O. The results of in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the knockdown of UBE2O can enhance the efficacy of interferon-α by upregulating IFIT3 expression. K236 was identified as a ubiquitination site in IFIT3, and the results of rescue experiments confirmed that the effect of UBE2O on interferon-α sensitivity is dependent on IFIT3 activity. ATO treatment inhibited UBE2O and increased IFIT3 expression, thereby increasing the effectiveness of interferon-α. In conclusion, these findings suggest that UBE2O worsens the therapeutic effect of interferon-α by targeting IFIT3 for ubiquitination and degradation.\n",

The pathognomonic feature of sepsis is a dysregulated inflammatory response arising from viral, bacterial, or fungal infections. Immune recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns is a hallmark of the host immune defense to combat microbes and to prevent the progression to sepsis. Mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) is a ubiquitous adaptor protein located at the outer mitochondrial membrane, which is activated by the cytosolic pattern recognition receptors, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 (MDA5), following binding of viral RNA agonists. <b><i>Recent Advances:</i></b> Substantial progress has been made in deciphering the activation of the MAVS pathway with its interacting proteins, downstream signaling events (interferon [IFN] regulatory factors, nuclear factor kappa B), and context-dependent type I/III IFN response. <b><i>Critical Issues:</i></b> In the evolutionary race between pathogens and the host, viruses have developed immune evasion strategies for cleavage, degradation, or blockade of proteins in the MAVS pathway. For example, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) M protein and ORF9b protein antagonize MAVS signaling and a protective type I IFN response. <b><i>Future Directions:</i></b> The role of MAVS as a sensor for nonviral pathogens, host cell injury, and metabolic perturbations awaits better characterization in the future. New technical advances in multidimensional single-cell analysis and single-molecule methods will accelerate the rate of new discoveries.

      "Title:  Signaling from the RNA sensor RIG-I is regulated by ufmylation.\n",
      "Abstract:  The RNA-binding protein RIG-I is a key initiator of the antiviral innate immune response. The signaling that mediates the antiviral response downstream of RIG-I is transduced through the adaptor protein MAVS and results in the induction of type I and III interferons (IFNs). This signal transduction occurs at endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–mitochondrial contact sites, to which RIG-I and other signaling proteins are recruited following their activation. RIG-I signaling is highly regulated to prevent aberrant activation of this pathway and dysregulated induction of IFN. Previously, we identified UFL1, the E3 ligase of the ubiquitin-like modifier conjugation system called ufmylation, as one of the proteins recruited to membranes at ER–mitochondrial contact sites in response to RIG-I activation. Here, we show that UFL1, as well as the process of ufmylation, promote IFN induction in response to RIG-I activation. We found that following RNA virus infection, UFL1 is recruited to the membrane-targeting protein 14–3-3ε and that this complex is then recruited to activated RIG-I to promote downstream innate immune signaling. Importantly, we found that 14–3-3ε has an increase in UFM1 conjugation following RIG-I activation. Additionally, loss of cellular ufmylation prevents the interaction of 14–3-3ε with RIG-I, which abrogates the interaction of RIG-I with MAVS and thus the downstream signal transduction that induces IFN. Our results define ufmylation as an integral regulatory component of the RIG-I signaling pathway and as a posttranslational control for IFN induction.\n",

      "Abstract:  Although interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT proteins) inhibit infection of many viruses by recognizing their RNA, the regulatory mechanisms involved remain unclear. Here we report a crystal structure of cap 0 (m<sup>7</sup>GpppN) RNA bound to human IFIT1 in complex with the C-terminal domain of human IFIT3. Structural, biochemical, and genetic studies suggest that IFIT3 binding to IFIT1 has dual regulatory functions: (1) extending the half-life of IFIT1 and thereby increasing its steady-state amounts in cells; and (2) allosterically regulating the IFIT1 RNA-binding channel, thereby enhancing the specificity of recognition for cap 0 but not cap 1 (m<sup>7</sup>GpppNm) or 5'-ppp RNA. Mouse Ifit3 lacks this key C-terminal domain and does not bind mouse Ifit1. The IFIT3 interaction with IFIT1 is important for restricting infection of viruses lacking 2'-O methylation in their RNA cap structures. Our experiments establish differences in the regulation of IFIT1 orthologs and define targets for modulation of human IFIT protein activity.\n",

Notably, nsp2 targets and degrades TBK1 (TANK binding kinase 1), the critical kinase in the innate immune response. Mechanistically, nsp2 induced the macroautophagy/autophagy process and recruited a selective autophagic receptor, NBR1 (NBR1 autophagy cargo receptor). NBR1 subsequently facilitated the K48-linked ubiquitination of TBK1 and delivered it for autophagosome-mediated degradation. Accordingly, the replication of rPEDV-Δnsp2 CoV was restrained by reduced autophagy and excess productions of type I IFNs and ISGs. Our data collectively define enteric CoV nsp2 as a novel virulence determinant, propose a crucial role of nsp2 in diminishing innate antiviral immunity by targeting TBK1 for NBR1-mediated selective autophagy, and pave the way to develop a new type of nsp2-based attenuated PEDV vaccine. The study also provides new insights into the prevention and treatment of other pathogenic CoVs.<b>Abbreviations</b>: 3-MA: 3-methyladenine; Baf A1: bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; CoV: coronavirus; CQ: chloroquine; dpi: days post-inoculation; DMVs: double-membrane vesicles; GABARAP: GABA type A receptor-associated protein; GFP: green fluorescent protein; GIGYF2: GRB10 interacting GYF protein 2; hpi: hours post-infection; IFA: immunofluorescence assay; IFIH1: interferon induced with helicase C domain 1; IFIT2: interferon induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2; IFITM1: interferon induced transmembrane protein 1; IFNB: interferon beta; IRF3: interferon regulatory factor 3; ISGs: interferon-stimulated genes; mAb: monoclonal antibody; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MAVS: mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein; NBR1: NBR1 autophagy cargo receptor; nsp2: non-structural protein 2; OAS1: 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1; PEDV: porcine epidemic diarrhea virus; PRRs: pattern recognition receptors; RIGI: RNA sensor RIG-I; RT-qPCR: reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; TBK1: TANK binding kinase 1; TCID<sub>50</sub>: 50% tissue culture infectious doses; VSV: vesicular stomatitis virus.\n",

      "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease with highly heterogeneous clinical symptoms and severity. There is complex pathogenesis of SLE, one of which is IFNs overproduction and downstream IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) upregulation. Identifying the key ISGs differentially expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with SLE and healthy people could help to further understand the role of the IFN pathway in SLE and discover potential diagnostic biomarkers. The differentially expressed ISGs (DEISG) in PBMCs of SLE patients and healthy persons were screened from two datasets of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. A total of 67 DEISGs, including 6 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and 61 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were identified by the \"DESeq2\" R package. According to Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, those DEISGs were mainly concentrated in the response to virus and immune system processes. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network showed that most of these DEISGs could interact strongly with each other. Then, IFIT1, RSAD2, IFIT3, USP18, ISG15, OASL, MX1, OAS2, OAS3, and IFI44 were considered to be hub ISGs in SLE by \"MCODE\" and \"Cytohubba\" plugins of Cytoscape, Moreover, the results of expression correlation suggested that 3 lncRNAs (NRIR, FAM225A, and LY6E-DT) were closely related to the IFN pathway. The lncRNA NRIR and mRNAs (RSAD2, USP18, IFI44, and ISG15) were selected as candidate ISGs for verification. RT-qPCR results showed that PBMCs from SLE patients had substantially higher expression levels of 5 ISGs compared to healthy controls (HCs). Additionally, statistical analyses revealed that the expression levels of these ISGs were strongly associated to various clinical symptoms, including thrombocytopenia and facial erythema, as well as laboratory indications, including the white blood cell (WBC) count and levels of autoantibodies. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve demonstrated that the IFI44, USP18, RSAD2, and IFN score had good diagnostic capabilities of SLE. According to our study, SLE was associated with ISGs including NRIR, RSAD2, USP18, IFI44, and ISG15, which may contribute to the future diagnosis and new personalized targeted therapies.\n",

      "The type I interferon response protects cells against invading viral pathogens. The cellular factors that mediate this defence are the products of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Although hundreds of ISGs have been identified since their discovery more than 25 years ago, only a few have been characterized with respect to antiviral activity. For most ISG products, little is known about their antiviral potential, their target specificity and their mechanisms of action. Using an overexpression screening approach, here we show that different viruses are targeted by unique sets of ISGs. We find that each viral species is susceptible to multiple antiviral genes, which together encompass a range of inhibitory activities. To conduct the screen, more than 380 human ISGs were tested for their ability to inhibit the replication of several important human and animal viruses, including hepatitis C virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, chikungunya virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and human immunodeficiency virus type-1. Broadly acting effectors included IRF1, C6orf150 (also known as MB21D1), HPSE, RIG-I (also known as DDX58), MDA5 (also known as IFIH1) and IFITM3, whereas more targeted antiviral specificity was observed with DDX60, IFI44L, IFI6, IFITM2, MAP3K14, MOV10, NAMPT (also known as PBEF1), OASL, RTP4, TREX1 and UNC84B (also known as SUN2). Combined expression of pairs of ISGs showed additive antiviral effects similar to those of moderate type I interferon doses. Mechanistic studies uncovered a common theme of translational inhibition for numerous effectors. Several ISGs, including ADAR, FAM46C, LY6E and MCOLN2, enhanced the replication of certain viruses, highlighting another layer of complexity in the highly pleiotropic type I interferon system.\n",

      "Although interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT proteins) inhibit infection of many viruses by recognizing their RNA, the regulatory mechanisms involved remain unclear. Here we report a crystal structure of cap 0 (m<sup>7</sup>GpppN) RNA bound to human IFIT1 in complex with the C-terminal domain of human IFIT3. Structural, biochemical, and genetic studies suggest that IFIT3 binding to IFIT1 has dual regulatory functions: (1) extending the half-life of IFIT1 and thereby increasing its steady-state amounts in cells; and (2) allosterically regulating the IFIT1 RNA-binding channel, thereby enhancing the specificity of recognition for cap 0 but not cap 1 (m<sup>7</sup>GpppNm) or 5'-ppp RNA. Mouse Ifit3 lacks this key C-terminal domain and does not bind mouse Ifit1. The IFIT3 interaction with IFIT1 is important for restricting infection of viruses lacking 2'-O methylation in their RNA cap structures. Our experiments establish differences in the regulation of IFIT1 orthologs and define targets for modulation of human IFIT protein activity.\n",

      "Inherited genetic factors can influence the severity of COVID-19, but the molecular explanation underpinning a genetic association is often unclear. Intracellular antiviral defenses can inhibit the replication of viruses and reduce disease severity. To better understand the antiviral defenses relevant to COVID-19, we used interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression screening to reveal that 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), through ribonuclease L, potently inhibits severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We show that a common splice-acceptor single-nucleotide polymorphism (Rs10774671) governs whether patients express prenylated OAS1 isoforms that are membrane-associated and sense-specific regions of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs or if they only express cytosolic, nonprenylated OAS1 that does not efficiently detect SARS-CoV-2. In hospitalized patients, expression of prenylated OAS1 was associated with protection from severe COVID-19, suggesting that this antiviral defense is a major component of a protective antiviral response.\n",

In recent years, the role of OAS1 in tumors has attracted attention, and it was found to be associated with prognosis in several tumors. However, the mechanism by which OAS1 affects tumors is unclear and pan-cancer study of OAS1 is necessary to better understand its implication in cancers.\n",
      "The expression, prognostic value, genetic alteration, alternative splicing events of OAS1 in pan-cancers were analyzed using TCGA, GTEx, HPA, GEPIA and OncoSplicing databases. OAS1 associated immune cell infiltration was evaluated using the ESTIMATE, xCell, CIBERSORT and QUANTISEQ algorithm. Single cell transcriptome data download using TISH database. Finally, the roles of the OAS1 on apoptosis, migration and invasion were investigated in two pancreatic cancer cells.\n",

In addition, we investigated the impact of OAS1 on genomic stability, methylation status, and other factors across different types of cancer, and the effects of these factors on prognosis. Notably, our study also demonstrated that OAS1 overexpression can contribute to CTL dysfunction and macrophage M2 polarization. In addition, cell experiments showed that the knockdown of OAS1 could reduce the invasive ability and increased the apoptosis rate of PAAD cells.\n",

      "Interferon (IFN) exerts its effects through interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), but its efficacy is limited by interferon resistance, which can be caused by the ubiquitination of key proteins. UBE2O was initially identified as a promising therapeutic target based on data from the TCGA and iUUCD 2.0 databases. Through the inhibition of UBE2O, interferon α/β signaling and overall interferon signaling were activated. Integrating data from proteomic, mass spectrometry, and survival analyses led to the identification of IFIT3, a mediator of interferon signaling, as a ubiquitination substrate of UBE2O. The results of in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the knockdown of UBE2O can enhance the efficacy of interferon-α by upregulating IFIT3 expression. K236 was identified as a ubiquitination site in IFIT3, and the results of rescue experiments confirmed that the effect of UBE2O on interferon-α sensitivity is dependent on IFIT3 activity. ATO treatment inhibited UBE2O and increased IFIT3 expression, thereby increasing the effectiveness of interferon-α. In conclusion, these findings suggest that UBE2O worsens the therapeutic effect of interferon-α by targeting IFIT3 for ubiquitination and degradation.\n",

      "Abstract:  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease with highly heterogeneous clinical symptoms and severity. There is complex pathogenesis of SLE, one of which is IFNs overproduction and downstream IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) upregulation. Identifying the key ISGs differentially expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with SLE and healthy people could help to further understand the role of the IFN pathway in SLE and discover potential diagnostic biomarkers. The differentially expressed ISGs (DEISG) in PBMCs of SLE patients and healthy persons were screened from two datasets of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. A total of 67 DEISGs, including 6 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and 61 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were identified by the \"DESeq2\" R package. According to Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, those DEISGs were mainly concentrated in the response to virus and immune system processes. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network showed that most of these DEISGs could interact strongly with each other. Then, IFIT1, RSAD2, IFIT3, USP18, ISG15, OASL, MX1, OAS2, OAS3, and IFI44 were considered to be hub ISGs in SLE by \"MCODE\" and \"Cytohubba\" plugins of Cytoscape, Moreover, the results of expression correlation suggested that 3 lncRNAs (NRIR, FAM225A, and LY6E-DT) were closely related to the IFN pathway. The lncRNA NRIR and mRNAs (RSAD2, USP18, IFI44, and ISG15) were selected as candidate ISGs for verification. RT-qPCR results showed that PBMCs from SLE patients had substantially higher expression levels of 5 ISGs compared to healthy controls (HCs). Additionally, statistical analyses revealed that the expression levels of these ISGs were strongly associated to various clinical symptoms, including thrombocytopenia and facial erythema, as well as laboratory indications, including the white blood cell (WBC) count and levels of autoantibodies. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve demonstrated that the IFI44, USP18, RSAD2, and IFN score had good diagnostic capabilities of SLE. According to our study, SLE was associated with ISGs including NRIR, RSAD2, USP18, IFI44, and ISG15, which may contribute to the future diagnosis and new personalized targeted therapies.\n",

      "Title:  Enteric coronavirus nsp2 is a virulence determinant that recruits NBR1 for autophagic targeting of TBK1 to diminish the innate immune response.\n",
      "Abstract:  Non-structural protein 2 (nsp2) exists in all coronaviruses (CoVs), while its primary function in viral pathogenicity, is largely unclear. One such enteric CoV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), causes high mortality in neonatal piglets worldwide. To determine the biological role of nsp2, we generated a PEDV mutant containing a complete <i>nsp2</i> deletion (rPEDV-Δnsp2) from a highly pathogenic strain by reverse genetics, showing that nsp2 was dispensable for PEDV infection, while its deficiency reduced viral replication <i>in vitro</i>. Intriguingly, rPEDV-Δnsp2 was entirely avirulent <i>in vivo</i>, with significantly increased productions of IFNB (interferon beta) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in various intestinal tissues of challenged newborn piglets. Notably, nsp2 targets and degrades TBK1 (TANK binding kinase 1), the critical kinase in the innate immune response. Mechanistically, nsp2 induced the macroautophagy/autophagy process and recruited a selective autophagic receptor, NBR1 (NBR1 autophagy cargo receptor). NBR1 subsequently facilitated the K48-linked ubiquitination of TBK1 and delivered it for autophagosome-mediated degradation. Accordingly, the replication of rPEDV-Δnsp2 CoV was restrained by reduced autophagy and excess productions of type I IFNs and ISGs. Our data collectively define enteric CoV nsp2 as a novel virulence determinant, propose a crucial role of nsp2 in diminishing innate antiviral immunity by targeting TBK1 for NBR1-mediated selective autophagy, and pave the way to develop a new type of nsp2-based attenuated PEDV vaccine. The study also provides new insights into the prevention and treatment of other pathogenic CoVs.<b>Abbreviations</b>: 3-MA: 3-methyladenine; Baf A1: bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; CoV: coronavirus; CQ: chloroquine; dpi: days post-inoculation; DMVs: double-membrane vesicles; GABARAP: GABA type A receptor-associated protein; GFP: green fluorescent protein; GIGYF2: GRB10 interacting GYF protein 2; hpi: hours post-infection; IFA: immunofluorescence assay; IFIH1: interferon induced with helicase C domain 1; IFIT2: interferon induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2; IFITM1: interferon induced transmembrane protein 1; IFNB: interferon beta; IRF3: interferon regulatory factor 3; ISGs: interferon-stimulated genes; mAb: monoclonal antibody; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MAVS: mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein; NBR1: NBR1 autophagy cargo receptor; nsp2: non-structural protein 2; OAS1: 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1; PEDV: porcine epidemic diarrhea virus; PRRs: pattern recognition receptors; RIGI: RNA sensor RIG-I; RT-qPCR: reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; TBK1: TANK binding kinase 1; TCID<sub>50</sub>: 50% tissue culture infectious doses; VSV: vesicular stomatitis virus.\n",

      "Abstract:  Inherited genetic factors can influence the severity of COVID-19, but the molecular explanation underpinning a genetic association is often unclear. Intracellular antiviral defenses can inhibit the replication of viruses and reduce disease severity. To better understand the antiviral defenses relevant to COVID-19, we used interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression screening to reveal that 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), through ribonuclease L, potently inhibits severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We show that a common splice-acceptor single-nucleotide polymorphism (Rs10774671) governs whether patients express prenylated OAS1 isoforms that are membrane-associated and sense-specific regions of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs or if they only express cytosolic, nonprenylated OAS1 that does not efficiently detect SARS-CoV-2. In hospitalized patients, expression of prenylated OAS1 was associated with protection from severe COVID-19, suggesting that this antiviral defense is a major component of a protective antiviral response.\n",

      "Title:  UBE2O reduces the effectiveness of interferon-α via degradation of IFIT3 in hepatocellular carcinoma.\n",
      "Abstract:  Interferon (IFN) exerts its effects through interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), but its efficacy is limited by interferon resistance, which can be caused by the ubiquitination of key proteins. UBE2O was initially identified as a promising therapeutic target based on data from the TCGA and iUUCD 2.0 databases. Through the inhibition of UBE2O, interferon α/β signaling and overall interferon signaling were activated. Integrating data from proteomic, mass spectrometry, and survival analyses led to the identification of IFIT3, a mediator of interferon signaling, as a ubiquitination substrate of UBE2O. The results of in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the knockdown of UBE2O can enhance the efficacy of interferon-α by upregulating IFIT3 expression. K236 was identified as a ubiquitination site in IFIT3, and the results of rescue experiments confirmed that the effect of UBE2O on interferon-α sensitivity is dependent on IFIT3 activity. ATO treatment inhibited UBE2O and increased IFIT3 expression, thereby increasing the effectiveness of interferon-α. In conclusion, these findings suggest that UBE2O worsens the therapeutic effect of interferon-α by targeting IFIT3 for ubiquitination and degradation.\n",

      "Abstract:  Although interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT proteins) inhibit infection of many viruses by recognizing their RNA, the regulatory mechanisms involved remain unclear. Here we report a crystal structure of cap 0 (m<sup>7</sup>GpppN) RNA bound to human IFIT1 in complex with the C-terminal domain of human IFIT3. Structural, biochemical, and genetic studies suggest that IFIT3 binding to IFIT1 has dual regulatory functions: (1) extending the half-life of IFIT1 and thereby increasing its steady-state amounts in cells; and (2) allosterically regulating the IFIT1 RNA-binding channel, thereby enhancing the specificity of recognition for cap 0 but not cap 1 (m<sup>7</sup>GpppNm) or 5'-ppp RNA. Mouse Ifit3 lacks this key C-terminal domain and does not bind mouse Ifit1. The IFIT3 interaction with IFIT1 is important for restricting infection of viruses lacking 2'-O methylation in their RNA cap structures. Our experiments establish differences in the regulation of IFIT1 orthologs and define targets for modulation of human IFIT protein activity.\n",

      "Abstract:  Gram-negative bacteria naturally secrete nano-sized outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), which are important mediators of communication and pathogenesis. OMV uptake by host cells activates TLR signalling via transported PAMPs. As important resident immune cells, alveolar macrophages are located at the air-tissue interface where they comprise the first line of defence against inhaled microorganisms and particles. To date, little is known about the interplay between alveolar macrophages and OMVs from pathogenic bacteria. The immune response to OMVs and underlying mechanisms are still elusive. Here, we investigated the response of primary human macrophages to bacterial vesicles (Legionella pneumophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Streptococcus pneumoniae) and observed comparable NF-κB activation across all tested vesicles. In contrast, we describe differential type I IFN signalling with prolonged STAT1 phosphorylation and strong Mx1 induction, blocking influenza A virus replication only for Klebsiella, E.coli and Salmonella OMVs. OMV-induced antiviral effects were less pronounced for endotoxin-free Clear coli OMVs and Polymyxin-treated OMVs. LPS stimulation could not mimic this antiviral status, while TRIF knockout abrogated it. Importantly, supernatant from OMV-treated macrophages induced an antiviral response in alveolar epithelial cells (AEC), suggesting OMV-induced intercellular communication. Finally, results were validated in an ex vivo infection model with primary human lung tissue. In conclusion, Klebsiella, E.coli and Salmonella OMVs induce antiviral immunity in macrophages via TLR4-TRIF-signaling to reduce viral replication in macrophages, AECs and lung tissue. These gram-negative bacteria induce antiviral immunity in the lung through OMVs, with a potential decisive and tremendous impact on bacterial and viral coinfection outcome. Video Abstract.\n",

This review focuses on the recent cellular, biochemical, and structural discoveries that have provided new insight as to how IFIT1 functions as both a sensor and effector molecule of the cellular innate immune system. IFIT1 can detect viral RNA lacking 2'-O methylation on their cap structures or displaying a 5'-triphosphate moiety and inhibit their translation or sequester them from active replication.

The Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus causing severe neurologic disease in humans. To date, the role of m<sup>6</sup>A modification in JEV infection remains unclear. Herein, we aimed to determine the impact of m<sup>6</sup>A methylation modification on JEV replication in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrated that the overexpression of the m<sup>6</sup>A reader protein YTHDF1 in vitro significantly inhibits JEV proliferation. Additionally, YTHDF1 negatively regulates JEV proliferation in YTHDF1 knockdown cells and YTHDF1 knockout mice. MeRIP-seq analysis indicated that YTHDF1 interacts with several interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), especially in IFIT3. Overall, our data showed that YTHDF1 played a vital role in inhibiting JEV replication. These findings bring novel insights into the specific mechanisms involved in the innate immune response to infection with JEV.

      "Abstract:  Interferons establish an antiviral state through the induction of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). The mechanisms and viral specificities for most ISGs remain incompletely understood. To enable high-throughput interrogation of ISG antiviral functions in pooled genetic screens while mitigating potentially confounding effects of endogenous interferon and antiproliferative/proapoptotic ISG activities, we adapted a CRISPR-activation (CRISPRa) system for inducible ISG expression in isogenic cell lines with and without the capacity to respond to interferons. We used this platform to screen for ISGs that restrict SARS-CoV-2. Results included ISGs previously described to restrict SARS-CoV-2 and novel candidate antiviral factors. We validated a subset of these by complementary CRISPRa and cDNA expression experiments. OAS1, a top-ranked hit across multiple screens, exhibited strong antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2, which required OAS1 catalytic activity. These studies demonstrate a high-throughput approach to assess antiviral functions within the ISG repertoire, exemplified by identification of multiple SARS-CoV-2 restriction factors.\n",

Here, we investigated gene expression profiles in human airway cultures (ALI and iALI models), infected or not with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), using our own and publicly available bulk and single-cell transcriptome datasets. SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly increased the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (<i>IFI44</i>, <i>IFIT1</i>, <i>IFIT3</i>, <i>IFI35</i>, <i>IRF9</i>, <i>MX1</i>, <i>OAS1</i>, <i>OAS3</i> and <i>ISG15</i>) and inflammatory genes (<i>NFKBIA</i>, <i>CSF1</i>, <i>FOSL1</i>, <i>IL32</i> and <i>CXCL10</i>) by day 4 post-infection, indicating activation of the interferon and immune responses to the virus. Extracellular matrix genes (<i>ITGB6</i>, <i>ITGB1</i> and <i>GJA1</i>) were also altered in infected cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing data revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection damaged the respiratory epithelium, particularly mature ciliated cells.

These data demonstrate that ALI/iALI models help to explain the airway epithelium response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and are a key tool for developing COVID-19 treatments.\n",

      "Abstract:  A major component of the protective antiviral host defense is contributed by the intracellular actions of the proteins encoded by interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs); among these are the interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs), consisting of four members in human and three in mouse. IFIT proteins do not have any known enzyme activity. Instead, they inhibit virus replication by binding and regulating the functions of cellular and viral proteins and RNAs. Although all IFITs are comprised of multiple copies of the degenerate tetratricopeptide repeats, their distinct tertiary structures enable them to bind different partners and affect host-virus interactions differently. The recent use of Ifit knockout mouse models has revealed novel antiviral functions of these proteins and new insights into the specificities of ISG actions. This article focuses on human and murine IFIT1 and IFIT2 by reviewing their mechanisms of action, their critical roles in protecting mice from viral pathogenesis, and viral strategies to evade IFIT action.\n",

      "Abstract:  Secretion of interferons (IFNs) from virus-infected cells is a hallmark of host antiviral immunity and in fact, IFNs exert their antiviral activities through the induction of antiviral proteins. The IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) family is among hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes. This family contains a cluster of duplicated loci. Most mammals have IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3 and IFIT5; however, bird, marsupial, frog and fish have only IFIT5. Regardless of species, IFIT5 is always adjacent to SLC16A12. IFIT family genes are predominantly induced by type I and type III interferons and are regulated by the pattern recognition and the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. IFIT family proteins are involved in many processes in response to viral infection. However, some viruses can escape the antiviral functions of the IFIT family by suppressing IFIT family genes expression or methylation of 5' cap of viral molecules. In addition, the variants of IFIT family genes could significantly influence the outcome of hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy. We believe that our current review provides a comprehensive picture for the community to understand the structure and function of IFIT family genes in response to pathogens in human, as well as in animals.\n",

      "Abstract:  Cells infected by influenza virus mount a large-scale antiviral response and most cells ultimately initiate cell-death pathways in an attempt to suppress viral replication. We performed a CRISPR-Cas9-knockout selection designed to identify host factors required for replication after viral entry. We identified a large class of presumptive antiviral factors that unexpectedly act as important proviral enhancers during influenza virus infection. One of these, IFIT2, is an interferon-stimulated gene with well-established antiviral activity but limited mechanistic understanding. As opposed to suppressing infection, we show in the present study that IFIT2 is instead repurposed by influenza virus to promote viral gene expression. CLIP-seq demonstrated that IFIT2 binds directly to viral and cellular messenger RNAs in AU-rich regions, with bound cellular transcripts enriched in interferon-stimulated mRNAs. Polysome and ribosome profiling revealed that IFIT2 prevents ribosome pausing on bound mRNAs. Together, the data link IFIT2 binding to enhanced translational efficiency for viral and cellular mRNAs and ultimately viral replication. Our findings establish a model for the normal function of IFIT2 as a protein that increases translation of cellular mRNAs to support antiviral responses and explain how influenza virus uses this same activity to redirect a classically antiviral protein into a proviral effector.\n",

The IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) family is among hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes. This family contains a cluster of duplicated loci. Most mammals have IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3 and IFIT5; however, bird, marsupial, frog and fish have only IFIT5. Regardless of species, IFIT5 is always adjacent to SLC16A12. IFIT family genes are predominantly induced by type I and type III interferons and are regulated by the pattern recognition and the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. IFIT family proteins are involved in many processes in response to viral infection. However, some viruses can escape the antiviral functions of the IFIT family by suppressing IFIT family genes expression or methylation of 5' cap of viral molecules. In addition, the variants of IFIT family genes could significantly influence the outcome of hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy. We believe that our current review provides a comprehensive picture for the community to understand the structure and function of IFIT family genes in response to pathogens in human, as well as in animals.\n",

      "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease with highly heterogeneous clinical symptoms and severity. There is complex pathogenesis of SLE, one of which is IFNs overproduction and downstream IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) upregulation. Identifying the key ISGs differentially expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with SLE and healthy people could help to further understand the role of the IFN pathway in SLE and discover potential diagnostic biomarkers. The differentially expressed ISGs (DEISG) in PBMCs of SLE patients and healthy persons were screened from two datasets of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. A total of 67 DEISGs, including 6 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and 61 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were identified by the \"DESeq2\" R package. According to Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, those DEISGs were mainly concentrated in the response to virus and immune system processes. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network showed that most of these DEISGs could interact strongly with each other. Then, IFIT1, RSAD2, IFIT3, USP18, ISG15, OASL, MX1, OAS2, OAS3, and IFI44 were considered to be hub ISGs in SLE by \"MCODE\" and \"Cytohubba\" plugins of Cytoscape, Moreover, the results of expression correlation suggested that 3 lncRNAs (NRIR, FAM225A, and LY6E-DT) were closely related to the IFN pathway. The lncRNA NRIR and mRNAs (RSAD2, USP18, IFI44, and ISG15) were selected as candidate ISGs for verification. RT-qPCR results showed that PBMCs from SLE patients had substantially higher expression levels of 5 ISGs compared to healthy controls (HCs). Additionally, statistical analyses revealed that the expression levels of these ISGs were strongly associated to various clinical symptoms, including thrombocytopenia and facial erythema, as well as laboratory indications, including the white blood cell (WBC) count and levels of autoantibodies. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve demonstrated that the IFI44, USP18, RSAD2, and IFN score had good diagnostic capabilities of SLE. According to our study, SLE was associated with ISGs including NRIR, RSAD2, USP18, IFI44, and ISG15, which may contribute to the future diagnosis and new personalized targeted therapies.\n",

      "Non-structural protein 2 (nsp2) exists in all coronaviruses (CoVs), while its primary function in viral pathogenicity, is largely unclear. One such enteric CoV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), causes high mortality in neonatal piglets worldwide. To determine the biological role of nsp2, we generated a PEDV mutant containing a complete <i>nsp2</i> deletion (rPEDV-Δnsp2) from a highly pathogenic strain by reverse genetics, showing that nsp2 was dispensable for PEDV infection, while its deficiency reduced viral replication <i>in vitro</i>. Intriguingly, rPEDV-Δnsp2 was entirely avirulent <i>in vivo</i>, with significantly increased productions of IFNB (interferon beta) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in various intestinal tissues of challenged newborn piglets. Notably, nsp2 targets and degrades TBK1 (TANK binding kinase 1), the critical kinase in the innate immune response. Mechanistically, nsp2 induced the macroautophagy/autophagy process and recruited a selective autophagic receptor, NBR1 (NBR1 autophagy cargo receptor). NBR1 subsequently facilitated the K48-linked ubiquitination of TBK1 and delivered it for autophagosome-mediated degradation. Accordingly, the replication of rPEDV-Δnsp2 CoV was restrained by reduced autophagy and excess productions of type I IFNs and ISGs. Our data collectively define enteric CoV nsp2 as a novel virulence determinant, propose a crucial role of nsp2 in diminishing innate antiviral immunity by targeting TBK1 for NBR1-mediated selective autophagy, and pave the way to develop a new type of nsp2-based attenuated PEDV vaccine. The study also provides new insights into the prevention and treatment of other pathogenic CoVs.<b>Abbreviations</b>: 3-MA: 3-methyladenine; Baf A1: bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; CoV: coronavirus; CQ: chloroquine; dpi: days post-inoculation; DMVs: double-membrane vesicles; GABARAP: GABA type A receptor-associated protein; GFP: green fluorescent protein; GIGYF2: GRB10 interacting GYF protein 2; hpi: hours post-infection; IFA: immunofluorescence assay; IFIH1: interferon induced with helicase C domain 1; IFIT2: interferon induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2; IFITM1: interferon induced transmembrane protein 1; IFNB: interferon beta; IRF3: interferon regulatory factor 3; ISGs: interferon-stimulated genes; mAb: monoclonal antibody; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MAVS: mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein; NBR1: NBR1 autophagy cargo receptor; nsp2: non-structural protein 2; OAS1: 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1; PEDV: porcine epidemic diarrhea virus; PRRs: pattern recognition receptors; RIGI: RNA sensor RIG-I; RT-qPCR: reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; TBK1: TANK binding kinase 1; TCID<sub>50</sub>: 50% tissue culture infectious doses; VSV: vesicular stomatitis virus.\n",

We show that a common splice-acceptor single-nucleotide polymorphism (Rs10774671) governs whether patients express prenylated OAS1 isoforms that are membrane-associated and sense-specific regions of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs or if they only express cytosolic, nonprenylated OAS1 that does not efficiently detect SARS-CoV-2.

      "Interferons establish an antiviral state through the induction of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). The mechanisms and viral specificities for most ISGs remain incompletely understood. To enable high-throughput interrogation of ISG antiviral functions in pooled genetic screens while mitigating potentially confounding effects of endogenous interferon and antiproliferative/proapoptotic ISG activities, we adapted a CRISPR-activation (CRISPRa) system for inducible ISG expression in isogenic cell lines with and without the capacity to respond to interferons. We used this platform to screen for ISGs that restrict SARS-CoV-2. Results included ISGs previously described to restrict SARS-CoV-2 and novel candidate antiviral factors. We validated a subset of these by complementary CRISPRa and cDNA expression experiments. OAS1, a top-ranked hit across multiple screens, exhibited strong antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2, which required OAS1 catalytic activity.

      "Gram-negative bacteria naturally secrete nano-sized outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), which are important mediators of communication and pathogenesis. OMV uptake by host cells activates TLR signalling via transported PAMPs. As important resident immune cells, alveolar macrophages are located at the air-tissue interface where they comprise the first line of defence against inhaled microorganisms and particles. To date, little is known about the interplay between alveolar macrophages and OMVs from pathogenic bacteria. The immune response to OMVs and underlying mechanisms are still elusive. Here, we investigated the response of primary human macrophages to bacterial vesicles (Legionella pneumophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Streptococcus pneumoniae) and observed comparable NF-κB activation across all tested vesicles. In contrast, we describe differential type I IFN signalling with prolonged STAT1 phosphorylation and strong Mx1 induction, blocking influenza A virus replication only for Klebsiella, E.coli and Salmonella OMVs. OMV-induced antiviral effects were less pronounced for endotoxin-free Clear coli OMVs and Polymyxin-treated OMVs. LPS stimulation could not mimic this antiviral status, while TRIF knockout abrogated it. Importantly, supernatant from OMV-treated macrophages induced an antiviral response in alveolar epithelial cells (AEC), suggesting OMV-induced intercellular communication. Finally, results were validated in an ex vivo infection model with primary human lung tissue. In conclusion, Klebsiella, E.coli and Salmonella OMVs induce antiviral immunity in macrophages via TLR4-TRIF-signaling to reduce viral replication in macrophages, AECs and lung tissue. These gram-negative bacteria induce antiviral immunity in the lung through OMVs, with a potential decisive and tremendous impact on bacterial and viral coinfection outcome. Video Abstract.\n",

In recent years, the role of OAS1 in tumors has attracted attention, and it was found to be associated with prognosis in several tumors. However, the mechanism by which OAS1 affects tumors is unclear and pan-cancer study of OAS1 is necessary to better understand its implication in cancers.\n",
      "The expression, prognostic value, genetic alteration, alternative splicing events of OAS1 in pan-cancers were analyzed using TCGA, GTEx, HPA, GEPIA and OncoSplicing databases. OAS1 associated immune cell infiltration was evaluated using the ESTIMATE, xCell, CIBERSORT and QUANTISEQ algorithm. Single cell transcriptome data download using TISH database. Finally, the roles of the OAS1 on apoptosis, migration and invasion were investigated in two pancreatic cancer cells.\n",
      "Our results revealed significant differences in OAS1 expression among various tumors, which had prognostic implications. In addition, we investigated the impact of OAS1 on genomic stability, methylation status, and other factors across different types of cancer, and the effects of these factors on prognosis. Notably, our study also demonstrated that OAS1 overexpression can contribute to CTL dysfunction and macrophage M2 polarization. In addition, cell experiments showed that the knockdown of OAS1 could reduce the invasive ability and increased the apoptosis rate of PAAD cells.\n",

      "Abstract:  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease with highly heterogeneous clinical symptoms and severity. There is complex pathogenesis of SLE, one of which is IFNs overproduction and downstream IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) upregulation. Identifying the key ISGs differentially expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with SLE and healthy people could help to further understand the role of the IFN pathway in SLE and discover potential diagnostic biomarkers. The differentially expressed ISGs (DEISG) in PBMCs of SLE patients and healthy persons were screened from two datasets of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. A total of 67 DEISGs, including 6 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and 61 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were identified by the \"DESeq2\" R package. According to Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, those DEISGs were mainly concentrated in the response to virus and immune system processes. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network showed that most of these DEISGs could interact strongly with each other. Then, IFIT1, RSAD2, IFIT3, USP18, ISG15, OASL, MX1, OAS2, OAS3, and IFI44 were considered to be hub ISGs in SLE by \"MCODE\" and \"Cytohubba\" plugins of Cytoscape, Moreover, the results of expression correlation suggested that 3 lncRNAs (NRIR, FAM225A, and LY6E-DT) were closely related to the IFN pathway. The lncRNA NRIR and mRNAs (RSAD2, USP18, IFI44, and ISG15) were selected as candidate ISGs for verification. RT-qPCR results showed that PBMCs from SLE patients had substantially higher expression levels of 5 ISGs compared to healthy controls (HCs). Additionally, statistical analyses revealed that the expression levels of these ISGs were strongly associated to various clinical symptoms, including thrombocytopenia and facial erythema, as well as laboratory indications, including the white blood cell (WBC) count and levels of autoantibodies. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve demonstrated that the IFI44, USP18, RSAD2, and IFN score had good diagnostic capabilities of SLE. According to our study, SLE was associated with ISGs including NRIR, RSAD2, USP18, IFI44, and ISG15, which may contribute to the future diagnosis and new personalized targeted therapies.\n",

      "Title:  Enteric coronavirus nsp2 is a virulence determinant that recruits NBR1 for autophagic targeting of TBK1 to diminish the innate immune response.\n",
      "Abstract:  Non-structural protein 2 (nsp2) exists in all coronaviruses (CoVs), while its primary function in viral pathogenicity, is largely unclear. One such enteric CoV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), causes high mortality in neonatal piglets worldwide. To determine the biological role of nsp2, we generated a PEDV mutant containing a complete <i>nsp2</i> deletion (rPEDV-Δnsp2) from a highly pathogenic strain by reverse genetics, showing that nsp2 was dispensable for PEDV infection, while its deficiency reduced viral replication <i>in vitro</i>. Intriguingly, rPEDV-Δnsp2 was entirely avirulent <i>in vivo</i>, with significantly increased productions of IFNB (interferon beta) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in various intestinal tissues of challenged newborn piglets. Notably, nsp2 targets and degrades TBK1 (TANK binding kinase 1), the critical kinase in the innate immune response. Mechanistically, nsp2 induced the macroautophagy/autophagy process and recruited a selective autophagic receptor, NBR1 (NBR1 autophagy cargo receptor). NBR1 subsequently facilitated the K48-linked ubiquitination of TBK1 and delivered it for autophagosome-mediated degradation. Accordingly, the replication of rPEDV-Δnsp2 CoV was restrained by reduced autophagy and excess productions of type I IFNs and ISGs. Our data collectively define enteric CoV nsp2 as a novel virulence determinant, propose a crucial role of nsp2 in diminishing innate antiviral immunity by targeting TBK1 for NBR1-mediated selective autophagy, and pave the way to develop a new type of nsp2-based attenuated PEDV vaccine. The study also provides new insights into the prevention and treatment of other pathogenic CoVs.<b>Abbreviations</b>: 3-MA: 3-methyladenine; Baf A1: bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; CoV: coronavirus; CQ: chloroquine; dpi: days post-inoculation; DMVs: double-membrane vesicles; GABARAP: GABA type A receptor-associated protein; GFP: green fluorescent protein; GIGYF2: GRB10 interacting GYF protein 2; hpi: hours post-infection; IFA: immunofluorescence assay; IFIH1: interferon induced with helicase C domain 1; IFIT2: interferon induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2; IFITM1: interferon induced transmembrane protein 1; IFNB: interferon beta; IRF3: interferon regulatory factor 3; ISGs: interferon-stimulated genes; mAb: monoclonal antibody; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MAVS: mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein; NBR1: NBR1 autophagy cargo receptor; nsp2: non-structural protein 2; OAS1: 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1; PEDV: porcine epidemic diarrhea virus; PRRs: pattern recognition receptors; RIGI: RNA sensor RIG-I; RT-qPCR: reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; TBK1: TANK binding kinase 1; TCID<sub>50</sub>: 50% tissue culture infectious doses; VSV: vesicular stomatitis virus.\n",

      "Abstract:  Inherited genetic factors can influence the severity of COVID-19, but the molecular explanation underpinning a genetic association is often unclear. Intracellular antiviral defenses can inhibit the replication of viruses and reduce disease severity. To better understand the antiviral defenses relevant to COVID-19, we used interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression screening to reveal that 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), through ribonuclease L, potently inhibits severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We show that a common splice-acceptor single-nucleotide polymorphism (Rs10774671) governs whether patients express prenylated OAS1 isoforms that are membrane-associated and sense-specific regions of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs or if they only express cytosolic, nonprenylated OAS1 that does not efficiently detect SARS-CoV-2. In hospitalized patients, expression of prenylated OAS1 was associated with protection from severe COVID-19, suggesting that this antiviral defense is a major component of a protective antiviral response.\n",

      "Abstract:  Gram-negative bacteria naturally secrete nano-sized outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), which are important mediators of communication and pathogenesis. OMV uptake by host cells activates TLR signalling via transported PAMPs. As important resident immune cells, alveolar macrophages are located at the air-tissue interface where they comprise the first line of defence against inhaled microorganisms and particles. To date, little is known about the interplay between alveolar macrophages and OMVs from pathogenic bacteria. The immune response to OMVs and underlying mechanisms are still elusive. Here, we investigated the response of primary human macrophages to bacterial vesicles (Legionella pneumophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Streptococcus pneumoniae) and observed comparable NF-κB activation across all tested vesicles. In contrast, we describe differential type I IFN signalling with prolonged STAT1 phosphorylation and strong Mx1 induction, blocking influenza A virus replication only for Klebsiella, E.coli and Salmonella OMVs. OMV-induced antiviral effects were less pronounced for endotoxin-free Clear coli OMVs and Polymyxin-treated OMVs. LPS stimulation could not mimic this antiviral status, while TRIF knockout abrogated it. Importantly, supernatant from OMV-treated macrophages induced an antiviral response in alveolar epithelial cells (AEC), suggesting OMV-induced intercellular communication. Finally, results were validated in an ex vivo infection model with primary human lung tissue. In conclusion, Klebsiella, E.coli and Salmonella OMVs induce antiviral immunity in macrophages via TLR4-TRIF-signaling to reduce viral replication in macrophages, AECs and lung tissue. These gram-negative bacteria induce antiviral immunity in the lung through OMVs, with a potential decisive and tremendous impact on bacterial and viral coinfection outcome. Video Abstract.\n",

      "Abstract:  Interferons establish an antiviral state through the induction of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). The mechanisms and viral specificities for most ISGs remain incompletely understood. To enable high-throughput interrogation of ISG antiviral functions in pooled genetic screens while mitigating potentially confounding effects of endogenous interferon and antiproliferative/proapoptotic ISG activities, we adapted a CRISPR-activation (CRISPRa) system for inducible ISG expression in isogenic cell lines with and without the capacity to respond to interferons. We used this platform to screen for ISGs that restrict SARS-CoV-2. Results included ISGs previously described to restrict SARS-CoV-2 and novel candidate antiviral factors. We validated a subset of these by complementary CRISPRa and cDNA expression experiments. OAS1, a top-ranked hit across multiple screens, exhibited strong antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2, which required OAS1 catalytic activity. These studies demonstrate a high-throughput approach to assess antiviral functions within the ISG repertoire, exemplified by identification of multiple SARS-CoV-2 restriction factors.\n",

Here, we investigated gene expression profiles in human airway cultures (ALI and iALI models), infected or not with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), using our own and publicly available bulk and single-cell transcriptome datasets. SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly increased the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (<i>IFI44</i>, <i>IFIT1</i>, <i>IFIT3</i>, <i>IFI35</i>, <i>IRF9</i>, <i>MX1</i>, <i>OAS1</i>, <i>OAS3</i> and <i>ISG15</i>) and inflammatory genes (<i>NFKBIA</i>, <i>CSF1</i>, <i>FOSL1</i>, <i>IL32</i> and <i>CXCL10</i>) by day 4 post-infection, indicating activation of the interferon and immune responses to the virus. Extracellular matrix genes (<i>ITGB6</i>, <i>ITGB1</i> and <i>GJA1</i>) were also altered in infected cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing data revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection damaged the respiratory epithelium, particularly mature ciliated cells. The expression of genes encoding intercellular communication and adhesion proteins was also deregulated, suggesting a mechanism to promote shedding of infected epithelial cells. These data demonstrate that ALI/iALI models help to explain the airway epithelium response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and are a key tool for developing COVID-19 treatments.\n",

      "Abstract:  Respiratory virus infections in humans cause a broad-spectrum of diseases that result in substantial morbidity and mortality annually worldwide. To reduce the global burden of respiratory viral diseases, preventative and therapeutic interventions that are accessible and effective are urgently needed, especially in countries that are disproportionately affected. Repurposing generic medicine has the potential to bring new treatments for infectious diseases to patients efficiently and equitably. In this study, we found that intranasal delivery of neomycin, a generic aminoglycoside antibiotic, induces the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the nasal mucosa that is independent of the commensal microbiota. Prophylactic or therapeutic administration of neomycin provided significant protection against upper respiratory infection and lethal disease in a mouse model of COVID-19. Furthermore, neomycin treatment protected Mx1 congenic mice from upper and lower respiratory infections with a highly virulent strain of influenza A virus. In Syrian hamsters, neomycin treatment potently mitigated contact transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In healthy humans, intranasal application of neomycin-containing Neosporin ointment was well tolerated and effective at inducing ISG expression in the nose in a subset of participants. These findings suggest that neomycin has the potential to be harnessed as a host-directed antiviral strategy for the prevention and treatment of respiratory viral infections.\n",

      "Abstract:  The antiviral cytokine interferon activates expression of interferon-stimulated genes to establish an antiviral state. Myxovirus resistance 2 (MX2, also known as MxB) is an interferon-stimulated gene that inhibits the nuclear import of HIV-1 and interacts with the viral capsid and cellular nuclear transport machinery. Here, we identified the myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) subunits myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1) and protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit-β (PPP1CB) as positively-acting regulators of MX2, interacting with its amino-terminal domain. We demonstrated that serine phosphorylation of the N-terminal domain at positions 14, 17 and 18 suppresses MX2 antiviral function, prevents interactions with the HIV-1 capsid and nuclear transport factors, and is reversed by MLCP. Notably, serine phosphorylation of the N-terminal domain also impedes MX2-mediated inhibition of nuclear import of cellular karyophilic cargo. We also found that interferon treatment reduces levels of phosphorylation at these serine residues and outline a homeostatic regulatory mechanism in which repression of MX2 by phosphorylation, together with MLCP-mediated dephosphorylation, balances the deleterious effects of MX2 on normal cell function with innate immunity against HIV-1.\n",

      "Abstract:  Oral epithelial cells (OEC) represent the first site of host interaction with viruses that infect the body through the oral route; however, their innate antiviral defense mechanisms yet to be defined. Previous studies have determined that OEC express pathogen-, damage-, or danger-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs or DAMPs), but their expression of key antiviral innate immune mediators, including type I interferons (type I IFN) and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) has not been studied extensively. We used the oral keratinocyte cell line, OKF6/TERT1, in the presence and absence of the viral mimics poly(I:C) and unmethylated CpG DNA, to define the expression of type I IFN and ISGs. We identified the basal expression of novel type I IFN genes IFNE and IFNK, while IFNB1 was induced by viral mimics, through the nuclear translocation of IRF3. Numerous ISGs were expressed at basal levels in OEC, with an apparent correlation between high expression and antiviral activity at the earlier stages of viral infection. Stimulation of OECs with poly(I:C) led to selective induction of ISGs, including MX1, BST2, PML, RSAD2, ISG15, and ZC3HAV1. Together, our results demonstrate that OECs exhibit a robust innate antiviral immune defense profile, which is primed to address a wide variety of pathogenic viruses that are transmitted orally.\n",

      "Abstract:  COVID-19 causes severe disease with poor outcomes. We tested the hypothesis that early SARS-CoV-2 viral infection disrupts innate immune responses. These changes may be important for understanding subsequent clinical outcomes. We obtained residual nasopharyngeal swab samples from individuals who requested COVID-19 testing for symptoms at drive-through COVID-19 clinical testing sites operated by the University of Utah. We applied multiplex immunoassays, real-time polymerase chain reaction assays and quantitative proteomics to 20 virus-positive and 20 virus-negative samples. ACE-2 transcripts increased with infection (OR =17.4, 95% CI [CI] =4.78-63.8) and increasing viral N1 protein transcript load (OR =1.16, CI =1.10-1.23). Transcripts for two interferons (IFN) were elevated, IFN-λ1 (OR =71, CI =7.07-713) and IFN-λ2 (OR =40.2, CI =3.86-419), and closely associated with viral N1 transcripts (OR =1.35, CI =1.23-1.49 and OR =1.33 CI =1.20-1.47, respectively). Only transcripts for IP-10 were increased among systemic inflammatory cytokines that we examined (OR =131, CI =1.01-2620). We found widespread discrepancies between transcription and translation. IFN proteins were unchanged or decreased in infected samples (IFN-γ OR =0.90 CI =0.33-0.79, IFN-λ2,3 OR =0.60 CI =0.48-0.74) suggesting viral-induced shut-off of host antiviral protein responses. However, proteins for IP-10 (OR =3.74 CI =2.07-6.77) and several interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) increased with viral load (BST-1 OR =25.1, CI =3.33-188; IFIT1 OR =19.5, CI =4.25-89.2; IFIT3 OR =245, CI =15-4020; MX-1 OR =3.33, CI =1.44-7.70). Older age was associated with substantial modifications of some effects. Ambulatory symptomatic patients had an innate immune response with SARS-CoV-2 infection characterized by elevated IFN, proinflammatory cytokine and ISG transcripts, but there is evidence of a viral-induced host shut-off of antiviral responses. Our findings may characterize the disrupted immune landscape common in patients with early disease.\n",

      "Abstract:  Upon viral infection, the 2', 5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-ribonuclease L (RNaseL) system works to cleave viral RNA, thereby blocking viral replication. However, it is unclear whether OAS proteins have a role in regulating gene expression. Here, we show that OAS1 and OAS3 act as negative regulators of the expression of chemokines and interferonresponsive genes in human macrophages. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease (Cas9) technology was used to engineer human myeloid cell lines in which the OAS1 or OAS3 gene was deleted. Neither OAS1 nor OAS3 was exclusively responsible for the degradation of rRNA in macrophages stimulated with poly(I:C), a synthetic surrogate for viral double-stranded (ds)RNA. An mRNA sequencing analysis revealed that genes related to type I interferon signaling and chemokine activity were increased in OAS1-/- and OAS3-/- macrophages treated with intracellular poly(I:C). Indeed, retinoic-acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I- and interferon-induced helicase C domain-containing protein (IFIH1 or MDA5)-mediated induction of chemokines and interferon-stimulated genes was regulated by OAS3, but Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)- and TLR4-mediated induction of those genes was modulated by OAS1 in macrophages. However, stimulation of these cells with type I interferons had no effect on OAS1- or OAS3-mediated chemokine secretion. These data suggest that OAS1 and OAS3 negatively regulate the expression of chemokines and interferon-responsive genes in human macrophages. [BMB Reports 2019; 52(2): 133-138].\n",

      "Title:  Endomembrane targeting of human OAS1 p46 augments antiviral activity.\n",
      "Abstract:  Many host RNA sensors are positioned in the cytosol to detect viral RNA during infection. However, most positive-strand RNA viruses replicate within a modified organelle co-opted from intracellular membranes of the endomembrane system, which shields viral products from cellular innate immune sensors. Targeting innate RNA sensors to the endomembrane system may enhance their ability to sense RNA generated by viruses that use these compartments for replication. Here, we reveal that an isoform of oligoadenylate synthetase 1, OAS1 p46, is prenylated and targeted to the endomembrane system. Membrane localization of OAS1 p46 confers enhanced access to viral replication sites and results in increased antiviral activity against a subset of RNA viruses including flaviviruses, picornaviruses, and SARS-CoV-2. Finally, our human genetic analysis shows that the <i>OAS1</i> splice-site SNP responsible for production of the OAS1 p46 isoform correlates with protection from severe COVID-19. This study highlights the importance of endomembrane targeting for the antiviral specificity of OAS1 and suggests that early control of SARS-CoV-2 replication through OAS1 p46 is an important determinant of COVID-19 severity.\n",

Among them, OAS1 activates RNase L to cleave RNA viruses genome, OAS2 activates downstream immune signaling pathways of IFNs, OAS3 induces RNase L to cut the genome of RNA virus and activate IFN I response to enhance the immune effect, and OASL inhibits the survival of RNA viruses by activating RIG-I signaling pathway but promotes the reproduction of DNA viruses by inhibiting the cGAS signaling pathway.

SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly increased the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (<i>IFI44</i>, <i>IFIT1</i>, <i>IFIT3</i>, <i>IFI35</i>, <i>IRF9</i>, <i>MX1</i>, <i>OAS1</i>, <i>OAS3</i> and <i>ISG15</i>) and inflammatory genes (<i>NFKBIA</i>, <i>CSF1</i>, <i>FOSL1</i>, <i>IL32</i> and <i>CXCL10</i>) by day 4 post-infection, indicating activation of the interferon and immune responses to the virus. Extracellular matrix genes (<i>ITGB6</i>, <i>ITGB1</i> and <i>GJA1</i>) were also altered in infected cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing data revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection damaged the respiratory epithelium, particularly mature ciliated cells. The expression of genes encoding intercellular communication and adhesion proteins was also deregulated, suggesting a mechanism to promote shedding of infected epithelial cells. These data demonstrate that ALI/iALI models help to explain the airway epithelium response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and are a key tool for developing COVID-19 treatments.\n",

Intracellular antiviral defenses can inhibit the replication of viruses and reduce disease severity. To better understand the antiviral defenses relevant to COVID-19, we used interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression screening to reveal that 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), through ribonuclease L, potently inhibits severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We show that a common splice-acceptor single-nucleotide polymorphism (Rs10774671) governs whether patients express prenylated OAS1 isoforms that are membrane-associated and sense-specific regions of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs or if they only express cytosolic, nonprenylated OAS1 that does not efficiently detect SARS-CoV-2. In hospitalized patients, expression of prenylated OAS1 was associated with protection from severe COVID-19, suggesting that this antiviral defense is a major component of a protective antiviral response.\n",

      "Many host RNA sensors are positioned in the cytosol to detect viral RNA during infection. However, most positive-strand RNA viruses replicate within a modified organelle co-opted from intracellular membranes of the endomembrane system, which shields viral products from cellular innate immune sensors. Targeting innate RNA sensors to the endomembrane system may enhance their ability to sense RNA generated by viruses that use these compartments for replication. Here, we reveal that an isoform of oligoadenylate synthetase 1, OAS1 p46, is prenylated and targeted to the endomembrane system. Membrane localization of OAS1 p46 confers enhanced access to viral replication sites and results in increased antiviral activity against a subset of RNA viruses including flaviviruses, picornaviruses, and SARS-CoV-2. Finally, our human genetic analysis shows that the <i>OAS1</i> splice-site SNP responsible for production of the OAS1 p46 isoform correlates with protection from severe COVID-19. This study highlights the importance of endomembrane targeting for the antiviral specificity of OAS1 and suggests that early control of SARS-CoV-2 replication through OAS1 p46 is an important determinant of COVID-19 severity.\n",

      "Upon viral infection, the 2', 5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-ribonuclease L (RNaseL) system works to cleave viral RNA, thereby blocking viral replication. However, it is unclear whether OAS proteins have a role in regulating gene expression. Here, we show that OAS1 and OAS3 act as negative regulators of the expression of chemokines and interferonresponsive genes in human macrophages. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease (Cas9) technology was used to engineer human myeloid cell lines in which the OAS1 or OAS3 gene was deleted. Neither OAS1 nor OAS3 was exclusively responsible for the degradation of rRNA in macrophages stimulated with poly(I:C), a synthetic surrogate for viral double-stranded (ds)RNA. An mRNA sequencing analysis revealed that genes related to type I interferon signaling and chemokine activity were increased in OAS1-/- and OAS3-/- macrophages treated with intracellular poly(I:C). Indeed, retinoic-acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I- and interferon-induced helicase C domain-containing protein (IFIH1 or MDA5)-mediated induction of chemokines and interferon-stimulated genes was regulated by OAS3, but Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)- and TLR4-mediated induction of those genes was modulated by OAS1 in macrophages. However, stimulation of these cells with type I interferons had no effect on OAS1- or OAS3-mediated chemokine secretion. These data suggest that OAS1 and OAS3 negatively regulate the expression of chemokines and interferon-responsive genes in human macrophages. [BMB Reports 2019; 52(2): 133-138].\n",

      "Interferons establish an antiviral state through the induction of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). The mechanisms and viral specificities for most ISGs remain incompletely understood. To enable high-throughput interrogation of ISG antiviral functions in pooled genetic screens while mitigating potentially confounding effects of endogenous interferon and antiproliferative/proapoptotic ISG activities, we adapted a CRISPR-activation (CRISPRa) system for inducible ISG expression in isogenic cell lines with and without the capacity to respond to interferons. We used this platform to screen for ISGs that restrict SARS-CoV-2. Results included ISGs previously described to restrict SARS-CoV-2 and novel candidate antiviral factors. We validated a subset of these by complementary CRISPRa and cDNA expression experiments. OAS1, a top-ranked hit across multiple screens, exhibited strong antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2, which required OAS1 catalytic activity. These studies demonstrate a high-throughput approach to assess antiviral functions within the ISG repertoire, exemplified by identification of multiple SARS-CoV-2 restriction factors.\n",

Myxovirus resistance 2 (MX2, also known as MxB) is an interferon-stimulated gene that inhibits the nuclear import of HIV-1 and interacts with the viral capsid and cellular nuclear transport machinery. Here, we identified the myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) subunits myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1) and protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit-β (PPP1CB) as positively-acting regulators of MX2, interacting with its amino-terminal domain. We demonstrated that serine phosphorylation of the N-terminal domain at positions 14, 17 and 18 suppresses MX2 antiviral function, prevents interactions with the HIV-1 capsid and nuclear transport factors, and is reversed by MLCP. Notably, serine phosphorylation of the N-terminal domain also impedes MX2-mediated inhibition of nuclear import of cellular karyophilic cargo. We also found that interferon treatment reduces levels of phosphorylation at these serine residues and outline a homeostatic regulatory mechanism in which repression of MX2 by phosphorylation, together with MLCP-mediated dephosphorylation, balances the deleterious effects of MX2 on normal cell function with innate immunity against HIV-1.\n",

      "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease with highly heterogeneous clinical symptoms and severity. There is complex pathogenesis of SLE, one of which is IFNs overproduction and downstream IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) upregulation. Identifying the key ISGs differentially expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with SLE and healthy people could help to further understand the role of the IFN pathway in SLE and discover potential diagnostic biomarkers. The differentially expressed ISGs (DEISG) in PBMCs of SLE patients and healthy persons were screened from two datasets of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. A total of 67 DEISGs, including 6 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and 61 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were identified by the \"DESeq2\" R package. According to Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, those DEISGs were mainly concentrated in the response to virus and immune system processes. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network showed that most of these DEISGs could interact strongly with each other. Then, IFIT1, RSAD2, IFIT3, USP18, ISG15, OASL, MX1, OAS2, OAS3, and IFI44 were considered to be hub ISGs in SLE by \"MCODE\" and \"Cytohubba\" plugins of Cytoscape, Moreover, the results of expression correlation suggested that 3 lncRNAs (NRIR, FAM225A, and LY6E-DT) were closely related to the IFN pathway. The lncRNA NRIR and mRNAs (RSAD2, USP18, IFI44, and ISG15) were selected as candidate ISGs for verification. RT-qPCR results showed that PBMCs from SLE patients had substantially higher expression levels of 5 ISGs compared to healthy controls (HCs). Additionally, statistical analyses revealed that the expression levels of these ISGs were strongly associated to various clinical symptoms, including thrombocytopenia and facial erythema, as well as laboratory indications, including the white blood cell (WBC) count and levels of autoantibodies. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve demonstrated that the IFI44, USP18, RSAD2, and IFN score had good diagnostic capabilities of SLE. According to our study, SLE was associated with ISGs including NRIR, RSAD2, USP18, IFI44, and ISG15, which may contribute to the future diagnosis and new personalized targeted therapies.\n",

      "Gram-negative bacteria naturally secrete nano-sized outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), which are important mediators of communication and pathogenesis. OMV uptake by host cells activates TLR signalling via transported PAMPs. As important resident immune cells, alveolar macrophages are located at the air-tissue interface where they comprise the first line of defence against inhaled microorganisms and particles. To date, little is known about the interplay between alveolar macrophages and OMVs from pathogenic bacteria. The immune response to OMVs and underlying mechanisms are still elusive. Here, we investigated the response of primary human macrophages to bacterial vesicles (Legionella pneumophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Streptococcus pneumoniae) and observed comparable NF-κB activation across all tested vesicles. In contrast, we describe differential type I IFN signalling with prolonged STAT1 phosphorylation and strong Mx1 induction, blocking influenza A virus replication only for Klebsiella, E.coli and Salmonella OMVs. OMV-induced antiviral effects were less pronounced for endotoxin-free Clear coli OMVs and Polymyxin-treated OMVs. LPS stimulation could not mimic this antiviral status, while TRIF knockout abrogated it. Importantly, supernatant from OMV-treated macrophages induced an antiviral response in alveolar epithelial cells (AEC), suggesting OMV-induced intercellular communication. Finally, results were validated in an ex vivo infection model with primary human lung tissue. In conclusion, Klebsiella, E.coli and Salmonella OMVs induce antiviral immunity in macrophages via TLR4-TRIF-signaling to reduce viral replication in macrophages, AECs and lung tissue. These gram-negative bacteria induce antiviral immunity in the lung through OMVs, with a potential decisive and tremendous impact on bacterial and viral coinfection outcome. Video Abstract.\n",

      "Oral epithelial cells (OEC) represent the first site of host interaction with viruses that infect the body through the oral route; however, their innate antiviral defense mechanisms yet to be defined. Previous studies have determined that OEC express pathogen-, damage-, or danger-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs or DAMPs), but their expression of key antiviral innate immune mediators, including type I interferons (type I IFN) and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) has not been studied extensively. We used the oral keratinocyte cell line, OKF6/TERT1, in the presence and absence of the viral mimics poly(I:C) and unmethylated CpG DNA, to define the expression of type I IFN and ISGs. We identified the basal expression of novel type I IFN genes IFNE and IFNK, while IFNB1 was induced by viral mimics, through the nuclear translocation of IRF3. Numerous ISGs were expressed at basal levels in OEC, with an apparent correlation between high expression and antiviral activity at the earlier stages of viral infection. Stimulation of OECs with poly(I:C) led to selective induction of ISGs, including MX1, BST2, PML, RSAD2, ISG15, and ZC3HAV1. Together, our results demonstrate that OECs exhibit a robust innate antiviral immune defense profile, which is primed to address a wide variety of pathogenic viruses that are transmitted orally.\n",

      "The abstract associated with the paper is:\n",
      "Non-structural protein 2 (nsp2) exists in all coronaviruses (CoVs), while its primary function in viral pathogenicity, is largely unclear. One such enteric CoV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), causes high mortality in neonatal piglets worldwide. To determine the biological role of nsp2, we generated a PEDV mutant containing a complete <i>nsp2</i> deletion (rPEDV-Δnsp2) from a highly pathogenic strain by reverse genetics, showing that nsp2 was dispensable for PEDV infection, while its deficiency reduced viral replication <i>in vitro</i>. Intriguingly, rPEDV-Δnsp2 was entirely avirulent <i>in vivo</i>, with significantly increased productions of IFNB (interferon beta) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in various intestinal tissues of challenged newborn piglets. Notably, nsp2 targets and degrades TBK1 (TANK binding kinase 1), the critical kinase in the innate immune response. Mechanistically, nsp2 induced the macroautophagy/autophagy process and recruited a selective autophagic receptor, NBR1 (NBR1 autophagy cargo receptor). NBR1 subsequently facilitated the K48-linked ubiquitination of TBK1 and delivered it for autophagosome-mediated degradation. Accordingly, the replication of rPEDV-Δnsp2 CoV was restrained by reduced autophagy and excess productions of type I IFNs and ISGs. Our data collectively define enteric CoV nsp2 as a novel virulence determinant, propose a crucial role of nsp2 in diminishing innate antiviral immunity by targeting TBK1 for NBR1-mediated selective autophagy, and pave the way to develop a new type of nsp2-based attenuated PEDV vaccine. The study also provides new insights into the prevention and treatment of other pathogenic CoVs.<b>Abbreviations</b>: 3-MA: 3-methyladenine; Baf A1: bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; CoV: coronavirus; CQ: chloroquine; dpi: days post-inoculation; DMVs: double-membrane vesicles; GABARAP: GABA type A receptor-associated protein; GFP: green fluorescent protein; GIGYF2: GRB10 interacting GYF protein 2; hpi: hours post-infection; IFA: immunofluorescence assay; IFIH1: interferon induced with helicase C domain 1; IFIT2: interferon induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2; IFITM1: interferon induced transmembrane protein 1; IFNB: interferon beta; IRF3: interferon regulatory factor 3; ISGs: interferon-stimulated genes; mAb: monoclonal antibody; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MAVS: mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein; NBR1: NBR1 autophagy cargo receptor; nsp2: non-structural protein 2; OAS1: 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1; PEDV: porcine epidemic diarrhea virus; PRRs: pattern recognition receptors; RIGI: RNA sensor RIG-I; RT-qPCR: reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; TBK1: TANK binding kinase 1; TCID<sub>50</sub>: 50% tissue culture infectious doses; VSV: vesicular stomatitis virus.\n",

In recent years, the role of OAS1 in tumors has attracted attention, and it was found to be associated with prognosis in several tumors. However, the mechanism by which OAS1 affects tumors is unclear and pan-cancer study of OAS1 is necessary to better understand its implication in cancers.\n",
      "The expression, prognostic value, genetic alteration, alternative splicing events of OAS1 in pan-cancers were analyzed using TCGA, GTEx, HPA, GEPIA and OncoSplicing databases. OAS1 associated immune cell infiltration was evaluated using the ESTIMATE, xCell, CIBERSORT and QUANTISEQ algorithm. Single cell transcriptome data download using TISH database. Finally, the roles of the OAS1 on apoptosis, migration and invasion were investigated in two pancreatic cancer cells.\n",
      "Our results revealed significant differences in OAS1 expression among various tumors, which had prognostic implications. In addition, we investigated the impact of OAS1 on genomic stability, methylation status, and other factors across different types of cancer, and the effects of these factors on prognosis. Notably, our study also demonstrated that OAS1 overexpression can contribute to CTL dysfunction and macrophage M2 polarization. In addition, cell experiments showed that the knockdown of OAS1 could reduce the invasive ability and increased the apoptosis rate of PAAD cells.\n",

      "Abstract:  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease with highly heterogeneous clinical symptoms and severity. There is complex pathogenesis of SLE, one of which is IFNs overproduction and downstream IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) upregulation. Identifying the key ISGs differentially expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with SLE and healthy people could help to further understand the role of the IFN pathway in SLE and discover potential diagnostic biomarkers. The differentially expressed ISGs (DEISG) in PBMCs of SLE patients and healthy persons were screened from two datasets of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. A total of 67 DEISGs, including 6 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and 61 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were identified by the \"DESeq2\" R package. According to Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, those DEISGs were mainly concentrated in the response to virus and immune system processes. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network showed that most of these DEISGs could interact strongly with each other. Then, IFIT1, RSAD2, IFIT3, USP18, ISG15, OASL, MX1, OAS2, OAS3, and IFI44 were considered to be hub ISGs in SLE by \"MCODE\" and \"Cytohubba\" plugins of Cytoscape, Moreover, the results of expression correlation suggested that 3 lncRNAs (NRIR, FAM225A, and LY6E-DT) were closely related to the IFN pathway. The lncRNA NRIR and mRNAs (RSAD2, USP18, IFI44, and ISG15) were selected as candidate ISGs for verification. RT-qPCR results showed that PBMCs from SLE patients had substantially higher expression levels of 5 ISGs compared to healthy controls (HCs). Additionally, statistical analyses revealed that the expression levels of these ISGs were strongly associated to various clinical symptoms, including thrombocytopenia and facial erythema, as well as laboratory indications, including the white blood cell (WBC) count and levels of autoantibodies. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve demonstrated that the IFI44, USP18, RSAD2, and IFN score had good diagnostic capabilities of SLE. According to our study, SLE was associated with ISGs including NRIR, RSAD2, USP18, IFI44, and ISG15, which may contribute to the future diagnosis and new personalized targeted therapies.\n",

      "Title:  Enteric coronavirus nsp2 is a virulence determinant that recruits NBR1 for autophagic targeting of TBK1 to diminish the innate immune response.\n",
      "Abstract:  Non-structural protein 2 (nsp2) exists in all coronaviruses (CoVs), while its primary function in viral pathogenicity, is largely unclear. One such enteric CoV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), causes high mortality in neonatal piglets worldwide. To determine the biological role of nsp2, we generated a PEDV mutant containing a complete <i>nsp2</i> deletion (rPEDV-Δnsp2) from a highly pathogenic strain by reverse genetics, showing that nsp2 was dispensable for PEDV infection, while its deficiency reduced viral replication <i>in vitro</i>. Intriguingly, rPEDV-Δnsp2 was entirely avirulent <i>in vivo</i>, with significantly increased productions of IFNB (interferon beta) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in various intestinal tissues of challenged newborn piglets. Notably, nsp2 targets and degrades TBK1 (TANK binding kinase 1), the critical kinase in the innate immune response. Mechanistically, nsp2 induced the macroautophagy/autophagy process and recruited a selective autophagic receptor, NBR1 (NBR1 autophagy cargo receptor). NBR1 subsequently facilitated the K48-linked ubiquitination of TBK1 and delivered it for autophagosome-mediated degradation. Accordingly, the replication of rPEDV-Δnsp2 CoV was restrained by reduced autophagy and excess productions of type I IFNs and ISGs. Our data collectively define enteric CoV nsp2 as a novel virulence determinant, propose a crucial role of nsp2 in diminishing innate antiviral immunity by targeting TBK1 for NBR1-mediated selective autophagy, and pave the way to develop a new type of nsp2-based attenuated PEDV vaccine. The study also provides new insights into the prevention and treatment of other pathogenic CoVs.<b>Abbreviations</b>: 3-MA: 3-methyladenine; Baf A1: bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; CoV: coronavirus; CQ: chloroquine; dpi: days post-inoculation; DMVs: double-membrane vesicles; GABARAP: GABA type A receptor-associated protein; GFP: green fluorescent protein; GIGYF2: GRB10 interacting GYF protein 2; hpi: hours post-infection; IFA: immunofluorescence assay; IFIH1: interferon induced with helicase C domain 1; IFIT2: interferon induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2; IFITM1: interferon induced transmembrane protein 1; IFNB: interferon beta; IRF3: interferon regulatory factor 3; ISGs: interferon-stimulated genes; mAb: monoclonal antibody; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MAVS: mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein; NBR1: NBR1 autophagy cargo receptor; nsp2: non-structural protein 2; OAS1: 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1; PEDV: porcine epidemic diarrhea virus; PRRs: pattern recognition receptors; RIGI: RNA sensor RIG-I; RT-qPCR: reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; TBK1: TANK binding kinase 1; TCID<sub>50</sub>: 50% tissue culture infectious doses; VSV: vesicular stomatitis virus.\n",

      "Abstract:  Inherited genetic factors can influence the severity of COVID-19, but the molecular explanation underpinning a genetic association is often unclear. Intracellular antiviral defenses can inhibit the replication of viruses and reduce disease severity. To better understand the antiviral defenses relevant to COVID-19, we used interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression screening to reveal that 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), through ribonuclease L, potently inhibits severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We show that a common splice-acceptor single-nucleotide polymorphism (Rs10774671) governs whether patients express prenylated OAS1 isoforms that are membrane-associated and sense-specific regions of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs or if they only express cytosolic, nonprenylated OAS1 that does not efficiently detect SARS-CoV-2. In hospitalized patients, expression of prenylated OAS1 was associated with protection from severe COVID-19, suggesting that this antiviral defense is a major component of a protective antiviral response.\n",

      "Abstract:  Gram-negative bacteria naturally secrete nano-sized outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), which are important mediators of communication and pathogenesis. OMV uptake by host cells activates TLR signalling via transported PAMPs. As important resident immune cells, alveolar macrophages are located at the air-tissue interface where they comprise the first line of defence against inhaled microorganisms and particles. To date, little is known about the interplay between alveolar macrophages and OMVs from pathogenic bacteria. The immune response to OMVs and underlying mechanisms are still elusive. Here, we investigated the response of primary human macrophages to bacterial vesicles (Legionella pneumophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Streptococcus pneumoniae) and observed comparable NF-κB activation across all tested vesicles. In contrast, we describe differential type I IFN signalling with prolonged STAT1 phosphorylation and strong Mx1 induction, blocking influenza A virus replication only for Klebsiella, E.coli and Salmonella OMVs. OMV-induced antiviral effects were less pronounced for endotoxin-free Clear coli OMVs and Polymyxin-treated OMVs. LPS stimulation could not mimic this antiviral status, while TRIF knockout abrogated it. Importantly, supernatant from OMV-treated macrophages induced an antiviral response in alveolar epithelial cells (AEC), suggesting OMV-induced intercellular communication. Finally, results were validated in an ex vivo infection model with primary human lung tissue. In conclusion, Klebsiella, E.coli and Salmonella OMVs induce antiviral immunity in macrophages via TLR4-TRIF-signaling to reduce viral replication in macrophages, AECs and lung tissue. These gram-negative bacteria induce antiviral immunity in the lung through OMVs, with a potential decisive and tremendous impact on bacterial and viral coinfection outcome. Video Abstract.\n",

      "Abstract:  Interferons establish an antiviral state through the induction of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). The mechanisms and viral specificities for most ISGs remain incompletely understood. To enable high-throughput interrogation of ISG antiviral functions in pooled genetic screens while mitigating potentially confounding effects of endogenous interferon and antiproliferative/proapoptotic ISG activities, we adapted a CRISPR-activation (CRISPRa) system for inducible ISG expression in isogenic cell lines with and without the capacity to respond to interferons. We used this platform to screen for ISGs that restrict SARS-CoV-2. Results included ISGs previously described to restrict SARS-CoV-2 and novel candidate antiviral factors. We validated a subset of these by complementary CRISPRa and cDNA expression experiments. OAS1, a top-ranked hit across multiple screens, exhibited strong antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2, which required OAS1 catalytic activity. These studies demonstrate a high-throughput approach to assess antiviral functions within the ISG repertoire, exemplified by identification of multiple SARS-CoV-2 restriction factors.\n",

      "Abstract:  Airway-liquid interface cultures of primary epithelial cells and of induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived airway epithelial cells (ALI and iALI, respectively) are physiologically relevant models for respiratory virus infection studies because they can mimic the in vivo human bronchial epithelium. Here, we investigated gene expression profiles in human airway cultures (ALI and iALI models), infected or not with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), using our own and publicly available bulk and single-cell transcriptome datasets. SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly increased the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (<i>IFI44</i>, <i>IFIT1</i>, <i>IFIT3</i>, <i>IFI35</i>, <i>IRF9</i>, <i>MX1</i>, <i>OAS1</i>, <i>OAS3</i> and <i>ISG15</i>) and inflammatory genes (<i>NFKBIA</i>, <i>CSF1</i>, <i>FOSL1</i>, <i>IL32</i> and <i>CXCL10</i>) by day 4 post-infection, indicating activation of the interferon and immune responses to the virus. Extracellular matrix genes (<i>ITGB6</i>, <i>ITGB1</i> and <i>GJA1</i>) were also altered in infected cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing data revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection damaged the respiratory epithelium, particularly mature ciliated cells. The expression of genes encoding intercellular communication and adhesion proteins was also deregulated, suggesting a mechanism to promote shedding of infected epithelial cells. These data demonstrate that ALI/iALI models help to explain the airway epithelium response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and are a key tool for developing COVID-19 treatments.\n",

      "Abstract:  The antiviral cytokine interferon activates expression of interferon-stimulated genes to establish an antiviral state. Myxovirus resistance 2 (MX2, also known as MxB) is an interferon-stimulated gene that inhibits the nuclear import of HIV-1 and interacts with the viral capsid and cellular nuclear transport machinery. Here, we identified the myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) subunits myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1) and protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit-β (PPP1CB) as positively-acting regulators of MX2, interacting with its amino-terminal domain. We demonstrated that serine phosphorylation of the N-terminal domain at positions 14, 17 and 18 suppresses MX2 antiviral function, prevents interactions with the HIV-1 capsid and nuclear transport factors, and is reversed by MLCP. Notably, serine phosphorylation of the N-terminal domain also impedes MX2-mediated inhibition of nuclear import of cellular karyophilic cargo. We also found that interferon treatment reduces levels of phosphorylation at these serine residues and outline a homeostatic regulatory mechanism in which repression of MX2 by phosphorylation, together with MLCP-mediated dephosphorylation, balances the deleterious effects of MX2 on normal cell function with innate immunity against HIV-1.\n",

      "Abstract:  Oral epithelial cells (OEC) represent the first site of host interaction with viruses that infect the body through the oral route; however, their innate antiviral defense mechanisms yet to be defined. Previous studies have determined that OEC express pathogen-, damage-, or danger-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs or DAMPs), but their expression of key antiviral innate immune mediators, including type I interferons (type I IFN) and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) has not been studied extensively. We used the oral keratinocyte cell line, OKF6/TERT1, in the presence and absence of the viral mimics poly(I:C) and unmethylated CpG DNA, to define the expression of type I IFN and ISGs. We identified the basal expression of novel type I IFN genes IFNE and IFNK, while IFNB1 was induced by viral mimics, through the nuclear translocation of IRF3. Numerous ISGs were expressed at basal levels in OEC, with an apparent correlation between high expression and antiviral activity at the earlier stages of viral infection. Stimulation of OECs with poly(I:C) led to selective induction of ISGs, including MX1, BST2, PML, RSAD2, ISG15, and ZC3HAV1. Together, our results demonstrate that OECs exhibit a robust innate antiviral immune defense profile, which is primed to address a wide variety of pathogenic viruses that are transmitted orally.\n",

We applied multiplex immunoassays, real-time polymerase chain reaction assays and quantitative proteomics to 20 virus-positive and 20 virus-negative samples. ACE-2 transcripts increased with infection (OR =17.4, 95% CI [CI] =4.78-63.8) and increasing viral N1 protein transcript load (OR =1.16, CI =1.10-1.23). Transcripts for two interferons (IFN) were elevated, IFN-λ1 (OR =71, CI =7.07-713) and IFN-λ2 (OR =40.2, CI =3.86-419), and closely associated with viral N1 transcripts (OR =1.35, CI =1.23-1.49 and OR =1.33 CI =1.20-1.47, respectively). Only transcripts for IP-10 were increased among systemic inflammatory cytokines that we examined (OR =131, CI =1.01-2620). We found widespread discrepancies between transcription and translation. IFN proteins were unchanged or decreased in infected samples (IFN-γ OR =0.90 CI =0.33-0.79, IFN-λ2,3 OR =0.60 CI =0.48-0.74) suggesting viral-induced shut-off of host antiviral protein responses. However, proteins for IP-10 (OR =3.74 CI =2.07-6.77) and several interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) increased with viral load (BST-1 OR =25.1, CI =3.33-188; IFIT1 OR =19.5, CI =4.25-89.2; IFIT3 OR =245, CI =15-4020; MX-1 OR =3.33, CI =1.44-7.70). Older age was associated with substantial modifications of some effects. Ambulatory symptomatic patients had an innate immune response with SARS-CoV-2 infection characterized by elevated IFN, proinflammatory cytokine and ISG transcripts, but there is evidence of a viral-induced host shut-off of antiviral responses. Our findings may characterize the disrupted immune landscape common in patients with early disease.\n",

      "Title:  OAS1 and OAS3 negatively regulate the expression of chemokines and interferon-responsive genes in human macrophages.\n",
      "Abstract:  Upon viral infection, the 2', 5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-ribonuclease L (RNaseL) system works to cleave viral RNA, thereby blocking viral replication. However, it is unclear whether OAS proteins have a role in regulating gene expression. Here, we show that OAS1 and OAS3 act as negative regulators of the expression of chemokines and interferonresponsive genes in human macrophages. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease (Cas9) technology was used to engineer human myeloid cell lines in which the OAS1 or OAS3 gene was deleted. Neither OAS1 nor OAS3 was exclusively responsible for the degradation of rRNA in macrophages stimulated with poly(I:C), a synthetic surrogate for viral double-stranded (ds)RNA. An mRNA sequencing analysis revealed that genes related to type I interferon signaling and chemokine activity were increased in OAS1-/- and OAS3-/- macrophages treated with intracellular poly(I:C). Indeed, retinoic-acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I- and interferon-induced helicase C domain-containing protein (IFIH1 or MDA5)-mediated induction of chemokines and interferon-stimulated genes was regulated by OAS3, but Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)- and TLR4-mediated induction of those genes was modulated by OAS1 in macrophages. However, stimulation of these cells with type I interferons had no effect on OAS1- or OAS3-mediated chemokine secretion. These data suggest that OAS1 and OAS3 negatively regulate the expression of chemokines and interferon-responsive genes in human macrophages. [BMB Reports 2019; 52(2): 133-138].\n",

      "Title:  Endomembrane targeting of human OAS1 p46 augments antiviral activity.\n",
      "Abstract:  Many host RNA sensors are positioned in the cytosol to detect viral RNA during infection. However, most positive-strand RNA viruses replicate within a modified organelle co-opted from intracellular membranes of the endomembrane system, which shields viral products from cellular innate immune sensors. Targeting innate RNA sensors to the endomembrane system may enhance their ability to sense RNA generated by viruses that use these compartments for replication. Here, we reveal that an isoform of oligoadenylate synthetase 1, OAS1 p46, is prenylated and targeted to the endomembrane system. Membrane localization of OAS1 p46 confers enhanced access to viral replication sites and results in increased antiviral activity against a subset of RNA viruses including flaviviruses, picornaviruses, and SARS-CoV-2. Finally, our human genetic analysis shows that the <i>OAS1</i> splice-site SNP responsible for production of the OAS1 p46 isoform correlates with protection from severe COVID-19. This study highlights the importance of endomembrane targeting for the antiviral specificity of OAS1 and suggests that early control of SARS-CoV-2 replication through OAS1 p46 is an important determinant of COVID-19 severity.\n",

      "Abstract:  The interaction between pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) and pathogen- associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) induces type I interferon (IFN) responses. IFNs stimulates hundreds of genes to exert its biological effects. OASs are the members of IFN-stimulate genes (ISGs). Among them, OAS1 activates RNase L to cleave RNA viruses genome, OAS2 activates downstream immune signaling pathways of IFNs, OAS3 induces RNase L to cut the genome of RNA virus and activate IFN I response to enhance the immune effect, and OASL inhibits the survival of RNA viruses by activating RIG-I signaling pathway but promotes the reproduction of DNA viruses by inhibiting the cGAS signaling pathway. However, the role of OASs in mycobacterial infection remains incomprehensible. In this review, we summarized the latest literature regarding the roles of OASs in mycobacterial infection.\n",

      "Abstract:  The nuclear envelope is a physical barrier that isolates the cellular DNA from the rest of the cell, thereby limiting pathogen invasion. The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has a remarkable ability to enter the nucleus of non-dividing target cells such as lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. While this step is critical for replication of the virus, it remains one of the less understood aspects of HIV infection. Here, we review the viral and host factors that favor or inhibit HIV entry into the nucleus, including the viral capsid, integrase, the central viral DNA flap, and the host proteins CPSF6, TNPO3, Nucleoporins, SUN1, SUN2, Cyclophilin A and MX2. We review recent perspectives on the mechanism of action of these factors, and formulate fundamental questions that remain. Overall, these findings deepen our understanding of HIV nuclear import and strengthen the favorable position of nuclear HIV entry for antiviral targeting.\n",

      "Abstract:  Interferon (IFN)-related DNA damage resistant signature (IRDS) genes are a subgroup of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) found upregulated in different cancer types, which promotes resistance to DNA damaging chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Along with briefly discussing IFNs and signalling in this review, we highlighted how different IRDS genes are affected by viruses. On the contrary, different strategies adopted to suppress a set of IRDS genes (STAT1, IRF7, OAS family, and BST2) to induce (chemo- and radiotherapy) sensitivity were deliberated. Significant biological pathways that comprise these genes were classified, along with their frequently associated genes (IFIT1/3, IFITM1, IRF7, ISG15, MX1/2 and OAS1/3/L). Major upstream regulators from the IRDS genes were identified, and different IFN types regulating these genes were outlined. Functional interfaces of IRDS proteins with DNA/RNA/ATP/GTP/NADP biomolecules featured a well-defined pharmacophore model for STAT1/IRF7-dsDNA and OAS1/OAS3/IFIH1-dsRNA complexes, as well as for the genes binding to GDP or NADP+. The Lys amino acid was found commonly interacting with the ATP phosphate group from OAS1/EIF2AK2/IFIH1 genes. Considering the premise that targeting IRDS genes mediated resistance offers an efficient strategy to resensitize tumour cells and enhances the outcome of anti-cancer treatment, this review can add some novel insights to the field.\n",

      "Airway-liquid interface cultures of primary epithelial cells and of induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived airway epithelial cells (ALI and iALI, respectively) are physiologically relevant models for respiratory virus infection studies because they can mimic the in vivo human bronchial epithelium. Here, we investigated gene expression profiles in human airway cultures (ALI and iALI models), infected or not with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), using our own and publicly available bulk and single-cell transcriptome datasets. SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly increased the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (<i>IFI44</i>, <i>IFIT1</i>, <i>IFIT3</i>, <i>IFI35</i>, <i>IRF9</i>, <i>MX1</i>, <i>OAS1</i>, <i>OAS3</i> and <i>ISG15</i>) and inflammatory genes (<i>NFKBIA</i>, <i>CSF1</i>, <i>FOSL1</i>, <i>IL32</i> and <i>CXCL10</i>) by day 4 post-infection, indicating activation of the interferon and immune responses to the virus. Extracellular matrix genes (<i>ITGB6</i>, <i>ITGB1</i> and <i>GJA1</i>) were also altered in infected cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing data revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection damaged the respiratory epithelium, particularly mature ciliated cells. The expression of genes encoding intercellular communication and adhesion proteins was also deregulated, suggesting a mechanism to promote shedding of infected epithelial cells. These data demonstrate that ALI/iALI models help to explain the airway epithelium response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and are a key tool for developing COVID-19 treatments.\n",

We show that a common splice-acceptor single-nucleotide polymorphism (Rs10774671) governs whether patients express prenylated OAS1 isoforms that are membrane-associated and sense-specific regions of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs or if they only express cytosolic, nonprenylated OAS1 that does not efficiently detect SARS-CoV-2.

      "Many host RNA sensors are positioned in the cytosol to detect viral RNA during infection. However, most positive-strand RNA viruses replicate within a modified organelle co-opted from intracellular membranes of the endomembrane system, which shields viral products from cellular innate immune sensors. Targeting innate RNA sensors to the endomembrane system may enhance their ability to sense RNA generated by viruses that use these compartments for replication. Here, we reveal that an isoform of oligoadenylate synthetase 1, OAS1 p46, is prenylated and targeted to the endomembrane system. Membrane localization of OAS1 p46 confers enhanced access to viral replication sites and results in increased antiviral activity against a subset of RNA viruses including flaviviruses, picornaviruses, and SARS-CoV-2. Finally, our human genetic analysis shows that the <i>OAS1</i> splice-site SNP responsible for production of the OAS1 p46 isoform correlates with protection from severe COVID-19. This study highlights the importance of endomembrane targeting for the antiviral specificity of OAS1 and suggests that early control of SARS-CoV-2 replication through OAS1 p46 is an important determinant of COVID-19 severity.\n",

      "Upon viral infection, the 2', 5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-ribonuclease L (RNaseL) system works to cleave viral RNA, thereby blocking viral replication. However, it is unclear whether OAS proteins have a role in regulating gene expression. Here, we show that OAS1 and OAS3 act as negative regulators of the expression of chemokines and interferonresponsive genes in human macrophages. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease (Cas9) technology was used to engineer human myeloid cell lines in which the OAS1 or OAS3 gene was deleted. Neither OAS1 nor OAS3 was exclusively responsible for the degradation of rRNA in macrophages stimulated with poly(I:C), a synthetic surrogate for viral double-stranded (ds)RNA. An mRNA sequencing analysis revealed that genes related to type I interferon signaling and chemokine activity were increased in OAS1-/- and OAS3-/- macrophages treated with intracellular poly(I:C). Indeed, retinoic-acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I- and interferon-induced helicase C domain-containing protein (IFIH1 or MDA5)-mediated induction of chemokines and interferon-stimulated genes was regulated by OAS3, but Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)- and TLR4-mediated induction of those genes was modulated by OAS1 in macrophages. However, stimulation of these cells with type I interferons had no effect on OAS1- or OAS3-mediated chemokine secretion. These data suggest that OAS1 and OAS3 negatively regulate the expression of chemokines and interferon-responsive genes in human macrophages. [BMB Reports 2019; 52(2): 133-138].\n",

Here, we review the viral and host factors that favor or inhibit HIV entry into the nucleus, including the viral capsid, integrase, the central viral DNA flap, and the host proteins CPSF6, TNPO3, Nucleoporins, SUN1, SUN2, Cyclophilin A and MX2.

      "Interferons establish an antiviral state through the induction of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). The mechanisms and viral specificities for most ISGs remain incompletely understood. To enable high-throughput interrogation of ISG antiviral functions in pooled genetic screens while mitigating potentially confounding effects of endogenous interferon and antiproliferative/proapoptotic ISG activities, we adapted a CRISPR-activation (CRISPRa) system for inducible ISG expression in isogenic cell lines with and without the capacity to respond to interferons. We used this platform to screen for ISGs that restrict SARS-CoV-2. Results included ISGs previously described to restrict SARS-CoV-2 and novel candidate antiviral factors. We validated a subset of these by complementary CRISPRa and cDNA expression experiments. OAS1, a top-ranked hit across multiple screens, exhibited strong antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2, which required OAS1 catalytic activity. These studies demonstrate a high-throughput approach to assess antiviral functions within the ISG repertoire, exemplified by identification of multiple SARS-CoV-2 restriction factors.\n",

Myxovirus resistance 2 (MX2, also known as MxB) is an interferon-stimulated gene that inhibits the nuclear import of HIV-1 and interacts with the viral capsid and cellular nuclear transport machinery. Here, we identified the myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) subunits myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1) and protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit-β (PPP1CB) as positively-acting regulators of MX2, interacting with its amino-terminal domain. We demonstrated that serine phosphorylation of the N-terminal domain at positions 14, 17 and 18 suppresses MX2 antiviral function, prevents interactions with the HIV-1 capsid and nuclear transport factors, and is reversed by MLCP. Notably, serine phosphorylation of the N-terminal domain also impedes MX2-mediated inhibition of nuclear import of cellular karyophilic cargo. We also found that interferon treatment reduces levels of phosphorylation at these serine residues and outline a homeostatic regulatory mechanism in which repression of MX2 by phosphorylation, together with MLCP-mediated dephosphorylation, balances the deleterious effects of MX2 on normal cell function with innate immunity against HIV-1.\n",

      "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease with highly heterogeneous clinical symptoms and severity. There is complex pathogenesis of SLE, one of which is IFNs overproduction and downstream IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) upregulation. Identifying the key ISGs differentially expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with SLE and healthy people could help to further understand the role of the IFN pathway in SLE and discover potential diagnostic biomarkers. The differentially expressed ISGs (DEISG) in PBMCs of SLE patients and healthy persons were screened from two datasets of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. A total of 67 DEISGs, including 6 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and 61 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were identified by the \"DESeq2\" R package. According to Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, those DEISGs were mainly concentrated in the response to virus and immune system processes. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network showed that most of these DEISGs could interact strongly with each other. Then, IFIT1, RSAD2, IFIT3, USP18, ISG15, OASL, MX1, OAS2, OAS3, and IFI44 were considered to be hub ISGs in SLE by \"MCODE\" and \"Cytohubba\" plugins of Cytoscape, Moreover, the results of expression correlation suggested that 3 lncRNAs (NRIR, FAM225A, and LY6E-DT) were closely related to the IFN pathway. The lncRNA NRIR and mRNAs (RSAD2, USP18, IFI44, and ISG15) were selected as candidate ISGs for verification. RT-qPCR results showed that PBMCs from SLE patients had substantially higher expression levels of 5 ISGs compared to healthy controls (HCs). Additionally, statistical analyses revealed that the expression levels of these ISGs were strongly associated to various clinical symptoms, including thrombocytopenia and facial erythema, as well as laboratory indications, including the white blood cell (WBC) count and levels of autoantibodies. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve demonstrated that the IFI44, USP18, RSAD2, and IFN score had good diagnostic capabilities of SLE. According to our study, SLE was associated with ISGs including NRIR, RSAD2, USP18, IFI44, and ISG15, which may contribute to the future diagnosis and new personalized targeted therapies.\n",

      "Gram-negative bacteria naturally secrete nano-sized outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), which are important mediators of communication and pathogenesis. OMV uptake by host cells activates TLR signalling via transported PAMPs. As important resident immune cells, alveolar macrophages are located at the air-tissue interface where they comprise the first line of defence against inhaled microorganisms and particles. To date, little is known about the interplay between alveolar macrophages and OMVs from pathogenic bacteria. The immune response to OMVs and underlying mechanisms are still elusive. Here, we investigated the response of primary human macrophages to bacterial vesicles (Legionella pneumophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Streptococcus pneumoniae) and observed comparable NF-κB activation across all tested vesicles. In contrast, we describe differential type I IFN signalling with prolonged STAT1 phosphorylation and strong Mx1 induction, blocking influenza A virus replication only for Klebsiella, E.coli and Salmonella OMVs. OMV-induced antiviral effects were less pronounced for endotoxin-free Clear coli OMVs and Polymyxin-treated OMVs. LPS stimulation could not mimic this antiviral status, while TRIF knockout abrogated it. Importantly, supernatant from OMV-treated macrophages induced an antiviral response in alveolar epithelial cells (AEC), suggesting OMV-induced intercellular communication. Finally, results were validated in an ex vivo infection model with primary human lung tissue. In conclusion, Klebsiella, E.coli and Salmonella OMVs induce antiviral immunity in macrophages via TLR4-TRIF-signaling to reduce viral replication in macrophages, AECs and lung tissue. These gram-negative bacteria induce antiviral immunity in the lung through OMVs, with a potential decisive and tremendous impact on bacterial and viral coinfection outcome. Video Abstract.\n",

    "Accurately use the data: Double-check that all data mentioned in the hypothesis match the dataset. Minor differences in measurement values detract from the hypothesis, and major differences or hallucinated values invalidate it.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Use correct reasoning: The logic of the hypothesis must be correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be based on causal mechanisms that explain elements of the data: The hypothesis should present chains of causation, potentially including feedback paths, that explain observations in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be plausible: The roles of entities and their causal relationships presented in the hypothesis should largely be known or consistent with current science. Proposed new roles or relationships (or those new to the experimental context) should be well supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be novel: Cases in which well-known mechanisms explain data elements are not interesting except as they form supporting structures for novel mechanisms.\n",

    "Be relevant to the higher-level goals of the experiment. For example, if the goal is drug target discovery, a novel causal mechanism leading to a disease phenotype is interesting. \n",

    "\n",
    "Hypothesis #1 is best because:\n",
    "It provides a clear and detailed mechanism involving both transcriptional and post-translational modifications. It explains how ZNF618 could be involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes important for the innate immune response and cell cycle regulation, while UBE2L6 could be involved in the ubiquitination and degradation of proteins during Dengue virus infection. The roles of the proteins involved support this dual mechanism of action.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is grounded in known molecular functions of the proteins involved. ZNF618's role in transcriptional regulation and UBE2L6's function in protein ubiquitination are well-documented, making their proposed roles in response to Dengue virus infection plausible.\n",
    "\n",
    "It proposes a specific interaction between transcriptional changes mediated by ZNF618 and ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation by UBE2L6 in the context of Dengue virus infection. This interaction has not been extensively studied, providing a novel insight into the cellular response to viral infection.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is actionable as it can be validated using relatively simple and cost-effective experimental techniques such as chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by sequencing to identify the genomic binding sites of ZNF618, and proteasome inhibition experiments in the presence of UBE2L6 knockdown to determine the specific targets of UBE2L6-mediated ubiquitination. These experiments are feasible and would provide significant insights into the molecular mechanisms proposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In comparison, while Hypotheses #2 and #3 also present interesting and plausible mechanisms, they either lack the detailed interaction between molecular components seen in Hypothesis #1 (Hypothesis #2) or propose mechanisms that, while novel, might require more complex and less straightforward experimental approaches to validate (Hypothesis #3). Hypothesis #1 not only integrates multiple molecular pathways but also suggests straightforward experimental approaches for validation, making it the strongest candidate based on the criteria provided.\n",

<task>
The data above is a set of genes/proteins significantly modulated in a perturbation experiment. We hypothesize that the perturbation caused one or more biological processes to be activated, inhibited, or otherwise altered in the tested system. Your task is to use your knowledge of molecular biology to propose a process or processes that the modulated proteins perform OR to reject our hypothesis, concluding that the set of proteins is not coherent and does not credibly implicate any specific process.

<detailed_instructions>

Review your knowledge of these proteins' functions, cellular locations, and known interactions. Think step by step to develop ideas for how they may be working together. Note which proteins are not included in common functions and mechanisms.

Use the output format described below to output your analysis as a JSON object that associates process names with (1) a list of official HGNC gene symbols (participating proteins) and (2) supporting analysis text. ONLY output the JSON object.

<task>
Based on the experiment description, analyze the dataset and develop a mechanistic,
causal hypothesis for the processes that led to the observed data. 
The proteins/genes in the dataset are hypothesized to be known to interact. 
Use your knowledge of these proteins and their interactions to develop chains of events
that connect experimental perturbations with molecular and phenotypic observations. 
The hypothesis should make specific predictions that could be experimentally validated. 
</task>

<detailed_instructions>
Data: Review the data to ensure that you understand the meaning of each observation. 
In your hypothesis, be sure that you correctly use the data and do not hallucinate any observations.

Background Knowledge: Review your knowledge of the functions of these proteins and the known interactions between them.

Hypothesis Criteria:
- Plausible
- Non-trivial
- Supports the higher-level goal of drug development
- Novel
- Actionable: is cost-effective in both time and money

Stringency: Your lab has limited resources in both reagents, equipment, and your time. 
Remember, your time is precious. You must use it well if you are to get your doctorate. 
If you do not think that there is any hypothesis that is worth following up with a validation experiment, say so.

Thought Process: Create a concise knowledge graph of the hypothesis as a list of the causal relationships between proteins, 
complexes, events, disease states, etc. This includes the your background knowledge that is relevant to 
the logic of the hypothesis. Use "Therefore:" to indicate hypothesized relationships. For example:

(A binds B) inactivates (B)
(B) performs (phosphorylation C)
(phosphorylation C) increases (active C)
Therefore: (A) decreases (active C)

Then think step-by-step through your reasoning process.

Propose your hypothesis in one paragraph, followed by the supporting reasoning.  

Format your output according to the output_format section below.

<task>
Write a concise yet comprehensive overview of the biological roles performed by the provided set of genes or proteins, adhering to the given biological context (if provided).
</task>

<detailed_instructions>
Review the provided list of genes/proteins and experiment description
Review your knowledge of these proteins' functions, cellular locations, and known interactions or pathways. Base your analysis on factual information from your training data.
Think step by step to develop ideas for how they may be working together, considering the biological context provided (if any). 
Please note which proteins are not included in common functions and mechanisms.

Use the output format described below to output your analysis as a JSON object that associates process names with (1) a list of official HGNC gene symbols (participating proteins) and (2) supporting analysis text. ONLY output the JSON object.

JNK phosphorylates SIRT1, activating its deacetylase activity in response to oxidative stress. MTOR also phosphorylates SIRT1, but suppress its deacetylase activity."

Activated ATM phosphorylates NBS1, activating its response to DNA damage response. Meanwhile, SIRT1 deacetylates NBS1, maintaining its active state to ensure effective DNA damage response "

<guidelines>
- Stick to factual information.
- Be specific and concise.
- If you can't identify clear processes or relationships, state this explicitly as \'system of unrelated proteins\'.
- Include an \'Unrelated or unclear proteins\' section if applicable.
- If no biological context is provided but seems necessary, add your proposed biological context in parentheses after the name, i.e. \"DNA Repair (Chemotherapy response)\".

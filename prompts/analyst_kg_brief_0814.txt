<task>
Based on the experiment description, analyze the dataset and develop a mechanistic, causal hypothesis for the processes that led to the observed data. The proteins/genes in the dataset are hypothesized to be known to interact; use your knowledge of these proteins and their interactions to develop chains of events that connect experimental perturbations with molecular and phenotypic observations. The hypothesis should make specific predictions that could be experimentally validated. 
</task>

<biological_context>
The hypothesis should support the higher-level goal of developing drug therapies for the disease.

1. Review the data to ensure that you understand the meaning of each observation. In your hypothesis, be sure that you correctly use the data and do not hallucinate any observations.

2. Review your knowledge of the functions of these proteins and the known interactions between them.

3. Based on the data and your knowledge, construct the hypothesis that you think best meets these criteria:
- Plausible
- Non-trivial
- Supports the higher-level goal of drug development
- Novel
- Actionable: is cost-effective in both time and money

4. Your lab has limited resources in both reagents, equipment, and your time. Remember, your time is precious. You must use it well if you are to get your doctorate. If you do not think that there is any hypothesis that is worth following up with a validation experiment, say so.

5. Output your hypothesis as follows:

## Knowledge Graph:
concise knowledge graph of as a list of the causal relationships between proteins, complexes, events, disease states, etc. 
"Therefore:" indicates hypothesized relationships. For example:

(A binds B) inactivates (B)
(B) performs (phosphorylation C)
(phosphorylation C) increases (active C)
Therefore: (A) decreases (active C)

## Hypothesis:
short descriptive paragraph.

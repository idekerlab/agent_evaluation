<task>
Review and rank hypotheses explaining experimental data based on these criteria:
1. Accurate use of data
2. Accurate use of scientific knowledge
3. Correct reasoning
4. Based on causal mechanisms explaining data
5. Plausible
6. Novel
7. Relevant to experiment goals
8. Actionable

Hypotheses failing accuracy or reasoning criteria are unacceptable.
</task>

<review_process>
1. Review each hypothesis, noting merits relative to criteria. Mark unacceptable ones.

<example>
Initial Review:
Hypothesis#1
...brief notes
Hypothesis#2
...brief notes
(and so on)
</example>

1. Rank hypotheses. Ranks range from 1 to N where N = number of hypotheses. Rank 1 is best. Rank N is worst, an unacceptable hypothesis.
Use same rank for equal preference. You must output your rankings in EXACTLY format in the following example:

<example>
Final Rankings:
Hypothesis#1: 5
Hypothesis#2: 3
...and so on.
</example>


2. Provide a summary review explaining your rankings. You must output the Summary Review exactly as in the following example.

<example>
Summary Review:
After careful review, I ranked Hypothesis #3 as best (rank=1), hypothesis #1 as the worst (rank = 5) while hypotheses #2 and #4 are tied (rank=3).

Hypothesis #3 is best because:
[Brief explanation of strengths]

In comparison, hypotheses #2 and #4 [Brief comparison]. ...and so on.

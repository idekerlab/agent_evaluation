You will evaluate multiple hypotheses that were derived from the experiment described above. You will rank them relative to each other on multiple criteria. You will also rate their quality on these criteria, separate from their rank. For example, the top-ranked hypothesis in this group might only be rated *Good*. Alternatively, two might be *Excellent* but 
 
1. Scientific Rigor

- Accuracy: Does the hypothesis correctly interpret the data and existing knowledge? Are the roles of the proteins/genes described accurately based on known pathways?
- Mechanistic Detail: Does the hypothesis clearly and specifically describe the molecular mechanisms, including key pathways and interactions?
- Specificity: Are the names of genes/proteins and pathways explicitly mentioned, avoiding vague terms?

2. Innovation and Novelty

- Originality: Does the hypothesis propose a novel mechanism or connection that extends beyond established knowledge?
- Insightfulness: Is the hypothesis non-trivial, offering new insights relevant to the study's goals?

3. Plausibility and Feasibility

- Grounding in Prior Knowledge: Is the hypothesis logically grounded in existing scientific literature and data?
- Realistic Assumptions: Are the assumptions reasonable and supported by evidence?

4. Actionability and Validation

- Testability: Is the hypothesis structured so that it can be empirically tested?
- Validation Strategy: Are the proposed validation methods (computational and experimental) appropriate, feasible, and thorough?
- Consideration of Redundancies/Compensatory Mechanisms: Does the hypothesis consider potential compensatory mechanisms or redundant pathways, and does it propose methods to account for them?

Quality Rating Categories:

*Excellent*
*Good*
*Satisfactory*
*Needs Improvement*
*Unsatisfactory*

Ranking: Ranks range from 1 to N, where N = the number of hypotheses. Rank 1 is the best. Rank N is the worst. Use the same rank for equal preference.

<review_process>
1. Review each hypothesis, assigning a quality rating for each criterion and overall quality. Also, provide a brief analysis explaining the rating. You must output your rankings in EXACTLY this format:

<example>

Hypothesis#1

Scientific Rigor = *Good* : (analysis)
Innovation and Novelty = *Needs Improvement*: (analysis)
Plausibility and Feasibility = *Excellent* : (analysis)
Actionability and Validation = *Good*: (analysis)
Overall = *Good* (analysis)

</example>

2. Rank the hypotheses. You must output your rankings in EXACTLY this format:

<example>
Final Rankings:
Hypothesis#1: 5
Hypothesis#2: 3
...and so on.

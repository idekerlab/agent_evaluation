# Deckhard Browser and Reviewer Status

## Project Overview
We've built two new static web interfaces for the Deckhard database:

1. **Deckhard Browser**: A browsing and searching interface for the database
2. **Deckhard Reviewer**: A reviewing interface for object lists

## Completed Features

### Deckhard Browser
- Interface with three panels: 
  - Left panel with predefined queries
  - Middle panel for search results
  - Right panel for object details
- SQL query execution via knowledge graph API
- Text-based search
- Object visualization with support for various display types
- Relationship viewing
- Review button for object lists that opens the reviewer interface

### Deckhard Reviewer
- Navigation between objects with Previous/Next buttons
- Dynamic form generation based on object list _criteria
- Support for different input types (text, textarea, checkbox, menu)
- Special handling for CSV data with horizontal and vertical scrolling
- Auto-saving functionality
- Validation based on data types
- Progress tracking
- Final review submission with validation

## Sample Object List Definition
In this repository:
- `sample_object_list_definition.json`: Definition of an object_list with the specified criteria
- `import_instructions.md`: Instructions for importing this into the Deckhard system

The object list includes two criteria:
1. **Comments**: A textarea for free-form text input
2. **Evaluation**: A menu with options "great!", "good.", "ok.", "needs work.", "unacceptable"

## Implementation Details
The implementation uses:
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Backend: Uses existing FastAPI endpoints
- Modular code structure for maintainability

### File Structure
- `app/static/browser.html`: The browser interface
- `app/static/reviewer.html`: The reviewer interface
- `app/static/css/reviewer.css`: Styles for the reviewer interface
- `app/static/js/reviewer-core.js`: Core initialization and utility functions
- `app/static/js/reviewer-ui.js`: UI rendering and form handling
- `app/static/js/reviewer-data.js`: Data handling and saving

## Next Steps
- Create the sample object_list in the Deckhard database using the provided instructions
- Add more visualization options for different data types
- Enhance search capabilities in the browser
- Improve error handling and validation
- Consider adding user authentication for reviews
- Add support for more complex scoring criteria

## Testing Instructions
1. Follow the instructions in `import_instructions.md` to create a sample object_list
2. Access the browser at `/browser`
3. Find and select the sample object_list
4. Click the "Review" button to open the reviewer interface
5. Navigate between objects using the Previous/Next buttons
6. Score objects using the form on the right
7. Save progress with the Save button
8. Submit the review when complete

## Usage Flow
1. Object lists can be viewed in the browser interface
2. When a user clicks the "Review" button on an object_list, the reviewer opens
3. The reviewer loads the object_list and its contained objects
4. The reviewer generates dynamic forms based on the object list's _criteria
5. Users can navigate between objects, score them, and save progress
6. When finished, users can submit the completed review

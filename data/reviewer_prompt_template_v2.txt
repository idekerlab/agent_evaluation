By focusing on a specific biological context, our analysts have generated hypotheses that might explain the observed data upon infection of a human cell line with the Dengue virus.

The biological context is: {biological_context}

Your task is to carefully review the hypotheses provided, and choose the best one.
To do so, please perform a critical evaluation based on the following criteria:

1) Mechanistic - The hypothesis includes one or more molecular mechanisms relevant to the biological context of interest.
2) Plausible - The hypothesis is plausible is grounded in known molecular functions and interactions.
3) Novel - The hypothesis proposes mechanisms either not known or not known to be relevant to the experimental context.
4) Actionable - The hypothesis actionable can be validated with relatively simple, low-cost experimental techniques".

You must execute your evaluation using only the information provided in the hypotheses.

When presenting your output, only include the following info:

1) Which hypothesis you deem to be the best one.
2) What are the reasons that dictated your decision.
3) If you deem the hypotheses of equivalent quality, don't make a choice; instead, provide a brief explanation supporting your decision.

Here are the hypotheses: {hypotheses_text}

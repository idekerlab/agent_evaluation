MRPS16 shows downregulation in RNAseq data (-2.1632) at 48h post-infection, suggesting capsid may disrupt mitochondrial translation machinery. This disruption could represent a viral strategy to alter host cell energy production or antiviral signaling originating from mitochondria.",

GADD45GIP1 is known to regulate cell cycle arrest and stress responses, which are often manipulated by viruses to create favorable replication conditions.
